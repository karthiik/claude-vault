## Current Focus

**2026 Theme:** *"The year I become visible outside Lockton."*

**Active Goals:**
- **G1: External Visibility** — 1 speaking gig + 2 articles published
- **G2: Innovation Leadership** — Thesis defined + 2 pilots with measurable impact
- **G3: Role Transition** — Smooth handoff to West CIO by Q2
- **G4: Global EA Practice** — Year 1 pitch approved + budget secured

**This Week's #1:** Seattle trip — pitch Innovation Sprint to Byron informally

---

## Key Relationships & Context

### Byron Clymer (Boss, Global CIO)
- Pushed Innovation Sprint deadline to 2/7 — breathing room
- Seattle next week — opportunity for informal pitch over drinks
- Expects: Survey synthesis deck + Innovation Sprint plan
- Style: Wants clear business outcomes, not just tech demos

### Innovation Sprint Committee
- **Jennifer Bryant** — excited to help, 3-person committee
- **Shanna Sommers** — development focus: more business engagement
- **You** — thesis owner, architecture lead

### Perficient & Forrester (EA Assessment)
- Perficient: Waiting on proposal (due 1/30)
- Forrester: Waiting on Jonathan Jenkins email
- Need a 3rd option: CapG? Slalom?

## Open Threads (Multi-Week)

### Career
- [ ] Cheryl backfill → Enterprise Architect — pitch to Byron
- [ ] Salesforce credits ($99K) — update Byron in 2-3 weeks
- [ ] Naveen re: Puru promotion — follow up

### Operational
- [ ] PHENOM functional design — end of Feb target
- [ ] Workday Workshop — beginning of March, KC office, invite Nandini & Rajesh
- [ ] Email Hiram Morero — Producer Org needs
- [ ] HIVE/Nuvento SOW — finalize pilot terms

### Personal
- [ ] Seattle flight — ice storm affecting, watch for cancellations
- [ ] London trip — dates confirmed with Glenn

## Important Nuances

- **Innovation framing:** Additive, not critical. Don't position thesis as criticism of digital team's POCs — it's about scaling the foundation they've built.
- **US market context:** Broker-driven, human-touch sales economy. Lower historical digital investment than UK/Europe. Fundamentals first.
- **M-Files risk:** Brandon said 5/1 is unrealistic. Architecture design and integration build are the blockers.
