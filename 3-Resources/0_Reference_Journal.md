### 🎥 Why Your Best Employees Quit Using AI After 3 Weeks (And the 6 Skills That Would Have Saved Them)
- **Source:** https://youtu.be/EZ4EjJ0iDDQ
- **Type:** YouTube
- **Context:** Work - AI adoption, training
- **NotebookLM:** ✅ Created notebook + slide deck
- **Key themes:** AI adoption failure, employee training, skill gaps, the "missing middle" in AI training
- **Summary:** The video argues that AI adoption fails because organizations focus on basic tool tours OR advanced technical coding, completely ignoring the intermediate "201-level" management skills where real productivity gains happen. The 6 skills that separate successful AI users from those who quit:
  1. **Context Assembly** — Knowing exactly what information, background, and constraints to provide AI (not too much, not too little)
  2. **Quality Judgment** — Determining when to trust AI output vs. when to verify it; detecting hallucinations
  3. **Task Decomposition** — Breaking complex work into "AI-appropriate chunks" (a management mindset)
  4. **Iterative Refinement** — Treating first output as a 70% draft, using structured passes to reach 95%
  5. **Workflow Integration** — Shifting AI from "side tool" to embedded capability ("this is how we do RFPs now")
  6. **Frontier Recognition** — Explicitly knowing where AI excels vs. fails; sharing failure cases with the team
  
  Key insight: None of these are technical prompting skills — they're management and judgment skills applied to a digital collaborator.

### 📰 We Need to Talk About How We Talk About AI
- **Source:** https://ftsg.com/we-need-to-talk-about-how-we-talk-about-ai/
- **Type:** Article
- **Context:** Work - thought leadership
- **NotebookLM:** Pending
- **Key themes:** Silicon Valley vs. enterprise language, risk externalization, philosophical vs. procedural framing
- **Summary:** Two distinct styles of AI discourse: Silicon Valley's abstract, future-tense philosophical style (velocity of ideas, externalized risk via VC portfolios) vs. enterprise's cautious, present-tense procedural style (blandness as safety, every commitment has a cost). Neither is wrong — they're coping strategies for different risk profiles. Mutual dismissal misses the deeper truth.

### 🧠 How to Focus to Change Your Brain | Huberman Lab Essentials
- **Source:** https://youtu.be/4AwyVTHEU3s
- **Type:** YouTube
- **Context:** Personal - learning
- **NotebookLM:** ✅ Created notebook + slide deck
- **Key themes:** Neuroplasticity, focus, attention, deep sleep, 90-minute learning bouts
- **Summary:** Andrew Huberman explains how adult neuroplasticity requires alertness + focused attention. Epinephrine for arousal, acetylcholine for spotlight on neural circuits. Visual focus triggers cognitive effort. Consolidation happens during deep sleep or non-sleep deep rest.
