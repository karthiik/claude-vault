# Education & Learning Coaching Session — Jan 17, 2026

**Duration:** ~10 minutes
**Focus:** Building out Education & Learning area index through Q&A coaching
**Output:** [[0_Education_Learning_Index]]

---

## Session Objective

Transform the bare Education & Learning index into a comprehensive area document focused on becoming a sought-after speaker and advisor.

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Vision Discovery

**5-year picture:** A well-respected technology leader who is invited for speaking engagements because I can be inspiring, funny, and can advise businesses on how best to leverage technology to get the outcomes they need.

**Key elements:**
- Invited (not seeking) speaking engagements
- Can move a room (inspiring, funny)
- Can move a business (advisory capability)

### Phase 2: Current Learning Assessment

| Program/Activity | Timeline | Status |
|------------------|----------|--------|
| MIT CTO Program | 9 months, starts March | Upcoming |
| Residency course with Jamie | 1 week, TBD topic | Planning |
| Claude Code / Life OS | Ongoing | Active |
| AI Snake Oil (book) | Current | In progress |

**Reading goal:** 6 books + published reviews in 2026

### Phase 3: Gap Identification

**Key insight:** The gap isn't *input* — plenty of research and consumption happening. The gap is **synthesis into output**.

- Finding topics that resonate with audiences
- Using Substack to incrementally build content
- Content → speaking material → book (the flywheel)

This connects directly to Health area insight: "creation over consumption."

### Phase 4: 2026 Focus

| Priority | Target |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Complete MIT CTO Program |
| 2 | Read 6 books + publish reviews |
| 3 | AI skill development — stay current, build solutions |

**Why MIT:** To lead innovation teams that can actually produce tangible business outcomes.

### Phase 5: Habits & Routines

| Activity | Current State |
|----------|---------------|
| Reading | ✅ 10-15 min morning + night (established) |
| AI experimentation | ✅ Daily at work (built into workflow) |
| Writing/synthesis | ❌ No cadence yet (gap) |
| MIT coursework | TBD — need to see workload starting March |

### Phase 6: Review Questions

Three chosen:
1. What did I learn and capture this week?
2. Did I turn any learning into content?
3. What's the next book in my queue?

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Synthesis over consumption" as the gap | Already consuming plenty — need output muscle |
| MIT as #1 priority | Directly serves innovation team leadership goal |
| Book reviews tie to Contribution | Monthly review habit lives in both areas |
| No writing cadence yet | Acknowledged gap — to be developed |

## Insights Discovered

### The Flywheel Model

Learning → Substack → Speaking → Book

The insight is that content builds incrementally. You don't write a book from scratch — you find what resonates through smaller posts, refine, and eventually have a book's worth of validated material.

### Reading as Both Joy and Duty

Reading happens because it's enjoyable AND it produces learning. The 10-15 min morning/night habit is established because it's intrinsically rewarding. Publishing reviews is the synthesis muscle that turns enjoyment into contribution.

### Residency Course with Jamie

A shared learning experience that spans Relationships + Learning areas. Topic TBD but considering AI or transformational leadership.
