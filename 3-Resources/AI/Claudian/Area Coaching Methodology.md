# Area Coaching Methodology

A repeatable framework for building out individual Life Area index files through structured Q&A coaching.

---

## Overview

This methodology transforms a bare area index into a comprehensive, personalized document through a sequence of coaching questions. Each question builds on the previous, moving from vision to tactics to habits.

**Time required:** 15-30 minutes per area
**Prerequisite:** [[Full Circle Areas Methodology]] Phase 1-4 complete (intention statement exists)
**Output:** Fully built Area Index file

---

## The Coaching Sequence

### Question 1: The Vision (5 Years)

**Purpose:** Paint the picture of success.

**Template:**
> "When you imagine yourself 5 years from now, having truly invested in [Area] — what does that look like? Not metrics — the *picture*."

**Listen for:**
- Concrete images (speaking at conferences, traveling, relationships)
- Feelings (freedom, pride, aliveness)
- People involved (family, mentees, audiences)

**Capture:**
- Short-term vision (this year)
- Long-term vision (5 years)

---

### Question 2: The Message/POV (for Contribution/Career)

**Purpose:** Surface their unique perspective or value.

**Template:**
> "What's the message you want to carry? When someone [reads your book / hears you speak / works with you] — what shift do you want them to have? What do you want to be *known for*?"

**Listen for:**
- Their superpower
- What makes them different
- The gap they fill

**Capture:**
- Positioning statement ("The Signal-Finder")
- Core message in their words

---

### Question 3: The Personal Dimension

**Purpose:** Ground the area in relationships and character.

**Template (varies by area):**
- **Contribution:** "What do you want [child/family] to learn from watching you?"
- **Health:** "What does being healthy enable for the people you love?"
- **Finances:** "What does security mean for your family, not just you?"

**Listen for:**
- Who they're doing this for
- The legacy beyond achievement
- Character they want to embody

**Capture:**
- Personal motivation beyond external success
- Relationship dimension of the area

---

### Question 4: Current State

**Purpose:** Honest assessment of where they are now.

**Template:**
> "Where are you today with [Area]? What's already working? What's the gap between now and the vision you described?"

**Listen for:**
- What's strong (foundation to build on)
- What's weak (gaps to close)
- Whether the gap is substance or consistency

**Capture:**
- Current state summary
- Gap analysis (what needs work)

---

### Question 5: 2026 Focus

**Purpose:** Identify 2-3 concrete wins for the year.

**Template:**
> "Given your Word of the Year is [word], what would make 2026 a win for [Area]? Think small and concrete — not 'become famous' but the *one or two things* that would feel like real progress."

**Listen for:**
- Concrete, measurable targets
- Connection to Word of the Year theme
- Realistic scope

**Capture:**
- 2-3 specific 2026 targets
- Status (not started, in progress, active)

---

### Question 6: Project Deep Dive (if applicable)

**Purpose:** Surface hidden depth in key projects.

**Template:**
> "Tell me more about [Project]. What is it? Where are you in the build? What's [other person's] role?"

**Listen for:**
- Projects that span multiple areas
- Hidden depth not captured elsewhere
- Roles and relationships

**Capture:**
- Project description
- Current status
- Roles (if collaborative)
- Add to Projects Index if not already there

---

### Question 7: Habits & Routines

**Purpose:** Establish the rhythm that maintains the area.

**Template:**
> "For [Area] to stay alive, it needs rhythm. What habits or routines would maintain this? Think daily, weekly, monthly."

**Listen for:**
- Realistic cadence given life constraints
- Specific activities (not vague goals)
- Connection to review cycles

**Capture:**
- Habits table with cadence and activity
- Content rhythm (if applicable)
- Relationship cadence (if applicable)

---

### Question 8: Review Questions

**Purpose:** Create accountability through gut-check questions.

**Template:**
> "When you do your weekly or monthly reviews, what questions would help you check in on [Area]? Not metrics — personal gut-checks."

**Offer examples:**
- "Did I publish this week?"
- "When did I last [do key activity]?"
- "Am I showing up as the person I want [key person] to see?"

**Listen for:**
- Questions they resonate with
- Questions that cover key dimensions
- Keep to 2-3 max (actionable, not overwhelming)

**Capture:**
- 2-3 review questions

## Area Index Structure

After coaching, compile into this structure:

```markdown
# [Area Name]

> [Intention statement from Areas Index]

---

## Vision

### The Picture (5 Years)
[Long-term vision]

## Session Log Format

After each coaching session, create a log:

**Location:** `3-Resources/AI/YYYY-MM-DD [Area] Coaching Session.md`

**Contents:**
- Session objective
- Questions asked and answers received
- Key decisions made
- Frameworks used
- Artifacts created
- Insights discovered
- Open threads for future sessions
- Meta observations (what worked, what to improve)

---

## Key Principles

1. **Vision before tactics** — Start with the picture, not the to-do list
2. **Two dimensions** — Most areas have public/external + personal/relational aspects
3. **Honest assessment** — Current state should identify both strengths and gaps
4. **Concrete 2026 targets** — Not "do better" but specific, measurable wins
5. **Realistic rhythm** — Habits must fit actual life constraints
6. **Simple review questions** — 2-3 gut-checks, not a long checklist
7. **Connection mapping** — Show how the area feeds and draws from others
