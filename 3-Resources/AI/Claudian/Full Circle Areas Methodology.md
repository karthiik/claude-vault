# Full Circle Areas Methodology

A repeatable framework for building and maintaining life area balance through AI-assisted coaching.

---

## Overview

This methodology transforms the "Full Circle" life framework into a personalized operating system for intentional living. Through structured conversation and iterative refinement, each life area gets a clear intention, vision, and action plan.

**Time required:** 30-60 minutes for initial setup; 15-30 minutes per area buildout
**Output:** Areas Index + Individual Area Index files
**Best for:** Annual planning, life transitions, regaining balance

## The Full Circle Framework

### Philosophy

No part of life exists in a vacuum. Each area connects to and supports the others:

```
                Health – Mind, Body & Spirit
                          |
Education & Learning -----+---- Relationships & Social Life
              \           |           /
               \          |          /
    Home & Environment ---+--- Career & Purpose
               /          |          \
              /           |           \
Joy, Creativity & Play ---+--- Finances & Security
                          |
               Contribution & Legacy
```

**The Flow:**
- Health → enables → Career performance
- Career → provides → Financial security
- Finances → enables → Home (environment)
- Home → supports → Health recovery
- Relationships → fuel → Joy
- Learning → accelerates → Career growth
- Contribution → deepens → Relationships

### The 8 Areas

| Area | Core Question |
|------|---------------|
| **Health – Mind, Body & Spirit** | How am I nurturing my physical, mental, and spiritual vitality? |
| **Relationships & Social Life** | How am I building deep connection and trust with those who matter? |
| **Career & Purpose** | How am I showing up in my work and expressing my purpose? |
| **Finances & Security** | How am I creating lasting security aligned with my values? |
| **Education & Learning** | How am I expanding my wisdom and staying curious? |
| **Joy, Creativity & Play** | How am I reclaiming wonder, adventure, and play? |
| **Home & Environment** | How am I nurturing a sanctuary that supports my wellbeing? |
| **Contribution & Legacy** | How am I giving back and building something that outlasts me? |

## The Process

### Phase 1: Word of the Year

**Goal:** Find the single word that anchors your year.

**The method:**
1. Reflect on the year ahead — what's the theme?
2. Consider transitions, goals, feelings you want to embody
3. Test words against your gut — does it resonate?
4. Write a 1-2 sentence expansion of what the word means to you

**Sample words and meanings:**
- **Emergence** — stepping into visibility, rising from internal to external
- **Abundance** — operating from overflow, not scarcity
- **Integration** — bringing parts of life into harmony
- **Depth** — choosing fewer things, going deeper

**Capture:**
- Your word + meaning
- Partner's word (if applicable)

---

### Phase 2: Anticipated Moments

**Goal:** Map the meaningful milestones you want to experience with presence.

**Categories:**
1. **Birthdays & Milestones** — family, friends, personal
2. **Career & Learning** — conferences, programs, achievements
3. **Travel & Joy** — trips, adventures, experiences

**Format:**

| Date | Moment | Area |
|------|--------|------|
| [When] | [What] | [Which area it serves] |

**Why this matters:**
- Makes the year feel concrete and grounded
- Highlights connections between areas
- Creates natural review checkpoints

---

### Phase 3: Area Intentions (Coaching)

**Goal:** Create a personalized intention statement for each area.

**The method: Jamie-style Coaching**

For each area, ask a question that:
- Connects to the person's specific life context
- References known transitions, relationships, or goals
- Invites reflection, not just description

**Sample questions by area:**

| Area | Jamie-style Question |
|------|---------------------|
| **Health** | "You mentioned wanting more energy and clarity. What does thriving physically, mentally, and spiritually look like for you right now?" |
| **Relationships** | "With [child] going to college, you and [partner] are entering a new chapter. What does thriving in relationships look like this year?" |
| **Career** | "You're transitioning from [old focus] to [new focus]. What does success in this new chapter look like?" |
| **Finances** | "What does financial security mean to you? Not the number — the feeling." |
| **Learning** | "What are you curious about right now? What would you love to master?" |
| **Joy** | "When do you feel most alive? What brings you genuine play and wonder?" |
| **Home** | "What would your home need to feel like a true sanctuary?" |
| **Contribution** | "What do you want to give back? What legacy are you building?" |

**Crafting the intention:**
1. Listen to the answer
2. Synthesize into a present-tense statement ("I am...")
3. Offer 2 versions: concise vs. detailed
4. User chooses or edits
5. Update the Areas Index

---

### Phase 4: Guiding Principles (Coaching)

**Goal:** Personalize the "Principles to Carry Forward" section — lessons learned that apply across all areas.

**The method: Jamie-style Coaching**

Ask a reflective question that invites the person to surface their own wisdom:

> "Looking across your life — the lessons you've learned, the mistakes that taught you something, the values that guide your decisions — what are the principles you want to carry forward? What truths have you discovered that you want to remember when things get hard?"

**Crafting the principles:**
1. Listen for themes: intuition, boundaries, health, gratitude, mindset
2. Extract 4-8 principles from their response
3. Format as: **Bold Title** — one-sentence expansion
4. Offer concise vs. detailed versions
5. User chooses or edits
6. Update the Areas Index

**Sample principles (for reference, not templates):**
- **Trust Your Gut** — Intuition is your compass; don't overthink
- **Choose You First** — Do what feels right, not what pleases others
- **Decide and Move** — Be confident; don't second-guess
- **Journal for Clarity** — Processing thoughts keeps you grounded
- **Practice Gratitude** — Abundance mindset over scarcity
- **Break the Pattern** — Name what's slipped before; don't repeat it

**Why this matters:**
- Principles are personal reminders, not generic advice
- They ground the system in lived experience
- They're the "fall back" when life gets hard

---

### Phase 5: Area Index Buildout

**Goal:** Create a dedicated index file for each area with depth.

**Structure for each Area Index:**

```markdown
# [Area Name]

> [Intention statement from Areas Index]

---

## Vision

What does thriving look like here?

- **Short-term (this year):** [specifics]
- **Long-term (5 years):** [specifics]

---

## Current State

## Review Questions

---

### Phase 6: Maintenance

**Goal:** Keep the system alive through regular review.

**Cadence:**

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Weekly** | Quick scan — any area neglected? Any urgent tasks? |
| **Monthly** | Check each area — where's the imbalance? |
| **Quarterly** | Deep review — adjust intentions, add/remove projects |
| **Annually** | Full reset — new Word of the Year, refresh all areas |

**Weekly Review Questions:**
1. Which areas got attention this week?
2. Which areas were neglected?
3. What's one small action for the most neglected area?
4. Am I living my Word of the Year?

## Key Principles

1. **Partner alignment** — Use shared frameworks when possible (e.g., Jamie's Full Circle)
2. **Word of the Year anchors everything** — One word, one theme, one north star
3. **Jamie-style coaching** — Questions are personal, not generic
4. **Intentions over goals** — "I am..." not "I will..."
5. **Principles from lived experience** — Guiding principles come from the user's own lessons, not templates
6. **Interconnection** — Each area supports the others
7. **Presence over perfection** — Anticipated Moments bring the year to life
8. **Maintenance is the work** — Review cadence keeps the system alive
