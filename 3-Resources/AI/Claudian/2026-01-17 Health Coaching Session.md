# Health Coaching Session — Jan 17, 2026

**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Focus:** Building out Health – Mind, Body & Spirit area index through Q&A coaching
**Output:** [[0_Health_Mind_Body_Spirit_Index]]

---

## Session Objective

Transform the bare Health index into a comprehensive area document covering Body, Mind, and Spirit dimensions.

---

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Vision Discovery

**Three dimensions identified:**

| Dimension | Vision |
|-----------|--------|
| **Body** | AT Ready by 50 — hike 100 miles of Appalachian Trail before turning 50 (Jan 2028) |
| **Mind** | Creation over consumption — shift from 5%/95% to net positive creation |
| **Spirit** | Contentment regardless of circumstance — happy with more, happy with less |

**Training approach:** Rucking with progressive weight increase (currently 20 lb).

### Phase 2: Current State Assessment

| Dimension | Working | Gap |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| Body | Rucking 2-3x/week | Snacking, weight training habit (equipment exists) |
| Mind | — | 95% consumption (YouTube, TV) / 5% creation |
| Spirit | Morning journaling, reading at bed/wake | No evening ritual |

**Pattern to break:** "You've let health slip before — eating, activity, strength."

Specific slips named:
- Post-travel Uber Eats habit (empty fridge trap)
- Crunchy snacks
- Weight training drops off despite having Tonal/Peloton

### Phase 3: 2026 Focus

| Dimension | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| Body | Eat less salty/restaurant food — meal prep, pre-stock before travel |
| Mind | Time blocks for creation vs. consumption — mornings + weekends |
| Spirit | Add evening ritual — AI-assisted quick reflection in Obsidian |

### Phase 4: Habits & Routines

**Body:**
- Rucking 2-3x/week (continue, increase weight)
- Weight training 2-3x/week (Tonal/Peloton)
- Meal prep weekly
- Pre-stock fridge before travel returns

**Mind:**
- Morning creation blocks (before consumption)
- Weekends for extended creation
- Rule: Create before you consume

**Spirit:**
- Morning journaling (continue)
- Evening ritual (to build) — AI-assisted review of day's notes/tasks
- Reading at bed/wake (continue)

### Phase 5: Review Questions

Three chosen:
1. Did I weight train this week?
2. Did I meal prep this week?
3. Did I do my evening ritual?

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| AT 100 as north star goal | Concrete, time-bound, requires all Body dimensions |
| "Creation over consumption" as Mind mantra | Simple, memorable, actionable |
| Evening ritual = AI-assisted | Fits Obsidian system, reduces friction, enables consistency |
| Meal prep + pre-stock as eating strategy | Addresses root cause (empty fridge), not just symptoms |

## Insights Discovered

### The Post-Travel Trap

A specific pattern emerged: returning from travel → empty fridge → Uber Eats → unhealthy eating spiral.

**Solution:** Pre-stock fridge before returning. This is a systems fix, not a willpower fix.

### Creation Over Consumption as Mind Health

The Mind dimension isn't about intellectual pursuits — it's about attention health. The ratio of creation to consumption determines:
- Focus and clarity
- Achievement across all goals
- Sense of meaning and progress

**The rule:** Mornings are for building, not scrolling.

### Evening Ritual as Spirit Anchor

The user wants an AI-assisted evening ritual that:
- Reviews notes/tasks from the day
- Enables quick journaling with low friction
- Closes the day intentionally

This is a workflow to build — could become a methodology for others.

## Open Threads

- [ ] Design evening ritual workflow in Obsidian
- [ ] Create AT 100 detailed training plan
