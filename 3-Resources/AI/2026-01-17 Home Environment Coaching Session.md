**Duration:** ~8 minutes

## Session Objective

Transform the bare Home & Environment index into a comprehensive area document focused on creating a space that supports creativity, health, and belonging.

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Vision Discovery

**Three dimensions of home:**

| Dimension | Vision |
|-----------|--------|
| **Creativity** | Minimal, clutter-free desk. Natural light. Deep work focus. |
| **Health** | Avoid lethargy triggers. Less alcohol. Movement throughout day. |
| **Vinay** | Clean, warm, safe. Enables creativity — playing, clarinet, studies. |

**Implicit fourth dimension:** Jamie — making the house feel like her home too when she visits.

### Phase 2: Current State Assessment

**What's working:**
- Workspace is in pretty good shape
- Prefer standing most of the day (healthy)
- Maid team starting quarterly deep cleans (Monday!)

**Gaps:**
- Upstairs is a mess
- Guest bedroom full of old stuff
- General clutter throughout house
- Work chair might need replacement (nice to have)

**Core insight:** Clutter is the root issue. Fix clutter, and creativity + Vinay's space + Jamie's comfort all improve together.

### Phase 3: 2026 Focus

| Priority | Target |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | KonMari declutter — minimize what's out |
| 2 | Clean out guest bedroom (upstairs) |
| 3 | New work chair (nice to have) |

### Phase 4: Habits & Routines

| Cadence | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Weekly | Robot vacuum + mop (downstairs + upstairs) |
| Monthly | Declutter check |
| Monthly | Filter replacement (furnace, vacuum, etc.) |
| Quarterly | Deep clean with maid team |

### Phase 5: Review Questions

Three chosen:
1. Is there clutter building up anywhere?
2. Does my home feel welcoming for Jamie's next visit?
3. Is Vinay's space supporting his focus?

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Less is more" as core principle | KonMari approach — simplicity enables everything else |
| Clutter as root cause | Solving clutter improves all dimensions simultaneously |
| Jamie's house as benchmark | She keeps a clean, well put together home |
| Robot + maid team as system | Automation + professional help for maintenance |

## Insights Discovered

### Clutter as the Root Issue

Every dimension of home improvement traces back to clutter:
- Workspace clarity → declutter
- Vinay's space → clean out upstairs
- Jamie's comfort → KonMari pass on common areas

**Insight:** One project (decluttering) unlocks multiple outcomes.

### Standing as Health Integration

Preferring to stand most of the day is a health habit embedded in the work environment. The workspace isn't just about productivity — it's about avoiding lethargy.

### Jamie's Standard as Benchmark

Jamie keeps her house clean and well put together. This is both a model to aspire to and a practical goal — making the house welcoming for her visits.
