# Shared Reasoning Log

This is the council's live thinking space. When agents gather, they document their reasoning HERE as they work — not after.

---

## Protocol

When `agents gather` is invoked:

1. **Create a new session block** with timestamp and idea summary
2. **Each agent writes to this file AS they reason** — in parallel
3. **Document the journey, not just the destination:**
   - Initial reaction to the idea
   - Each step of logic ("I noticed X, which means Y...")
   - Decision points ("Considered A vs B, went with A because...")
   - Key insights discovered along the way
   - Doubts or uncertainties
4. **Persist everything** — even dead ends and revised thinking
5. **Conclude with final position** after reasoning is complete

This creates a transparent record of HOW conclusions were reached.

## Active Session

*No active session. Say "agents gather" + your idea to begin.*
