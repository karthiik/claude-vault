## What We Did

### Phase 1: Vision Discovery

**Two sources of aliveness:**
1. Like-minded people — the energy of collaboration, shared passion
2. Nature — with Jamie, with Skai, or solo

**What "enough" looks like:**
| Type | Target |
|------|--------|
| International trips | 2 per year |
| Adventure motorcycle trip | 1 per year |
| Local trips with Jamie | A few per year |

### Phase 2: Current State Assessment

**What's working:**
- International travel happening (1 last year, India/Dubai planned)
- Local trip with Jamie coming (January)
- Small joys exist: sunset watching, park walks with Jamie and Skai

**Gap identified:**
> Motorcycle riding gets squeezed when life gets busy.

This is the first thing sacrificed under pressure — the adventure that feeds the soul but feels "optional."

### Phase 3: 2026 Focus

Three wins:
1. Protect the motorcycle trip — don't let it get squeezed (national trip booked)
2. India/Dubai with Jamie (summer)
3. Local trips with Jamie (January + more)

### Phase 4: Habits & Routines

**Small joys between big adventures:**
| Cadence | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Weekend | Local motorcycle rides |
| Weekend | Nature time |
| Regular | Watching the sunset |
| Regular | Walks with Jamie and Skai |

### Phase 5: Review Questions

Three chosen:
1. Did I ride this week?
2. When is my next adventure planned?
3. Did I have fun this week?

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| "Protect the motorcycle trip" as #1 focus | It's the first to get squeezed — needs explicit protection |
| Define "enough" concretely | Prevents vague guilt; clear targets enable satisfaction |
| Small joys matter | Big trips are great, but daily/weekly joy sustains |
| "Did I have fun?" as review question | Simple gut check that cuts through productivity bias |

## Insights Discovered

### The Sacrifice Pattern

When life gets busy, the motorcycle trip is the first to go. This is a common pattern — we sacrifice joy for "productivity" thinking it's optional. But joy isn't optional; it's fuel.

**Insight:** Joy needs explicit protection. If it's not scheduled and defended, it will be squeezed.

### Small Joys as Maintenance

Big adventures are highlights, but small joys (sunset watching, park walks, weekend rides) are the maintenance that keeps the soul healthy between adventures.

**Insight:** "Did I have fun this week?" is a powerful, simple review question.

### Skai as Joy Companion

The dog (Skai) appears as a joy companion — walks with Jamie and Skai are a small but regular source of happiness.
