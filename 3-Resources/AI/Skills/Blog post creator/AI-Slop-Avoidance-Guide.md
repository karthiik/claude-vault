## What is "AI Slop"?

"AI slop" (2025 Word of the Year per Merriam-Webster) refers to digital content made with generative AI that is perceived as lacking effort, quality, or deeper meaning, produced at overwhelming volume. The term carries the same pejorative weight as "spam."

Related terms:
- **Slopper**: Someone overly reliant on generative AI tools
- **Glazing**: Excessive or insincere praise (a hallmark of ChatGPT's sycophantic tendencies)

## PHRASES TO AVOID

### Opening Lines (The Worst)

Never start with:
- "In today's [fast-paced/ever-evolving/dynamic] world..."
- "In the [landscape/realm/world] of..."
- "Picture this..."
- "Imagine a world where..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "Let's delve into..."
- "Let's unpack..."
- "As we navigate..."
- "In an era of..."
- "In the dynamic world of..."

### Middle-of-Post Cliches

- "It's not just X, it's Y" (AI's favorite sentence structure)
- "The result?" (rhetorical question AI loves)
- "Not only... but also..."
- "Whether you're X or Y..."
- "From X to Y..." (false range)
- "At its core..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "It goes without saying..."
- "Needless to say..."
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "Moving forward..."
- "On this journey..."
- "This begs the question..."

### Closing Lines

- "In summary..."
- "In conclusion..."
- "To sum up..."
- "All in all..."
- "The bottom line is..."
- "At the heart of it all..."
- "Only time will tell..."

### LinkedIn-Specific Cringe

- "I'm thrilled to announce..."
- "Excited to share..."
- "Humbled and honored..."
- "Proud to be part of..."
- "Let me know if you need any modifications" (literally leaving ChatGPT's closing line in)
- "Thoughts?" (lazy engagement bait)
- Anything ending with "🚀" or "✨"

### Puffery Phrases (Making Things Sound Important)

- "A testament to..."
- "Speaks volumes about..."
- "Serves as a reminder that..."

## PUNCTUATION AND FORMATTING

### The Em Dash Problem

**The Issue**: AI overuses em dashes (—) where humans would use commas, parentheses, or colons. It's become so associated with ChatGPT that some call it the "ChatGPT hyphen."

**The Reality**: Em dashes are legitimate punctuation that humans use too. The problem is:
1. AI uses them too frequently
2. AI uses them in formulaic, predictable ways
3. AI uses them where other punctuation would be more natural

**What to do**:
- Don't avoid em dashes entirely, but use them sparingly
- Ask yourself: would a comma work here? If yes, use the comma
- Limit to 1-2 per paragraph maximum
- Never use multiple em dashes in the same sentence

### Emoji Overuse

**AI's Favorite Emojis** (avoid overusing):
- 🚀 (the worst offender)
- ✨
- ⭐
- 💡
- 🎯
- 🔥
- 💪

**Rules**:
- Maximum 2 emojis per LinkedIn post
- Never bookend titles with emojis (⭐ Title Here ⭐)
- Never use emojis as bullet points unless it's genuinely on-brand

### Formatting Red Flags

- Excessive bold text
- Every other sentence bolded for "emphasis"
- Headers with emoji decoration
- Rigid intro → 3 bullets → conclusion structure
- Numbered lists where prose would work better
- Section headings that sound like textbook chapters

---

## STRUCTURAL PATTERNS TO AVOID

### The AI Blog Post Template

AI defaults to this structure for everything:
1. Hook/intro paragraph
2. 3-4 body paragraphs with headers
3. Bullet point list
4. Conclusion summarizing the post

**Problem**: This structure is fine sometimes, but AI uses it for EVERYTHING.

**Fix**: Vary your structure. Sometimes skip the intro. Sometimes end abruptly. Sometimes use no headers at all.

### The Rule of Three Addiction

AI loves grouping things in threes:
- "Innovation, collaboration, and excellence"
- "Fast, efficient, and reliable"
- "Plan, execute, and deliver"

**Fix**: Use two things. Or four. Or just one. Real writing has variety.

### Moralizing Wrap-ups

AI always ends with a lesson or takeaway, even when the content doesn't warrant one.

**Fix**: Not everything needs a moral. Sometimes you can just... end.

### The "Journey" Framing

AI frames everything as a journey:
- "Our journey began..."
- "As we continue on this journey..."
- "Join us on this exciting journey..."

**Fix**: Just describe what happened. Skip the journey metaphor.

## AUTHENTICITY MARKERS (What TO Do)

### What AI Can't Replicate Well

1. **Specificity**: Concrete details from actual experience
   - Bad: "We had productive discussions"
   - Good: "We spent 45 minutes arguing about API versioning before anyone touched the whiteboard"

2. **Imperfection**: Real writing has personality quirks
   - Sentence fragments. On purpose.
   - Starting sentences with "And" or "But"
   - Occasional informality

3. **Actual opinions**: AI hedges everything
   - Bad: "There are various perspectives on this issue"
   - Good: "I think X is wrong, and here's why"

4. **Humor and self-deprecation**: AI plays it safe
   - Real humans make jokes that might not land
   - Real humans admit when something didn't go as planned

5. **Varied sentence length**:
   - AI writes medium-length sentences consistently
   - Real writing: Short. Then a longer one that builds on the idea and adds complexity. Then short again.

### Voice Consistency

Your writing should sound like YOU across posts. AI-assisted writers often have inconsistent voices because each prompt produces different output.

## QUICK CHECKLIST BEFORE POSTING

Before publishing, scan for:

- [ ] No "delve," "tapestry," "vibrant," "landscape," "realm"
- [ ] No "In today's [adjective] world" opening
- [ ] No more than 2-3 em dashes total
- [ ] No more than 2 emojis (and no 🚀)
- [ ] At least one specific, concrete detail from real experience
- [ ] Varied sentence lengths
- [ ] No "thrilled/excited/humbled" opening
- [ ] No generic moralizing conclusion
- [ ] Does this sound like something I would actually say out loud?

## REWRITING EXAMPLES

### Before (AI Slop)
> In today's fast-paced business landscape, we're thrilled to announce our groundbreaking new initiative. This transformative program—designed to leverage cutting-edge technology—will revolutionize how we approach customer engagement. It's not just about innovation; it's about creating meaningful connections. As we embark on this exciting journey, we remain committed to delivering best-in-class solutions. The future is bright! 🚀✨

### After (Human)
> We're launching a new customer program next month. The idea came from watching our support team spend 20 minutes per call doing the same three lookups. We built something to cut that to 2 minutes. It's not fancy, but it works. We'll share results after the pilot.

---

## THE ULTIMATE TEST

Read your writing out loud. Would you actually say this to a colleague? If it sounds like a press release or a corporate mission statement, rewrite it.

Real people don't "leverage synergies." They "work together." Real people don't "embark on journeys." They "start projects." Real people don't find things "transformative." They find things "useful" or "helpful" or sometimes just "good."

Write like a person talking to another person. That's it.
