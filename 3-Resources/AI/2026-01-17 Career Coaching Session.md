---

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Foundation (CLAUDE.md Setup)

1. **User Preferences** — Built out profile section in [[CLAUDE.md]]
   - Professional context (role, industry, expertise)
   - Communication preferences
   - How to help / things to avoid

### Phase 2: Career Index Structure

2. **Analyzed existing note** — Started with basic Career Index (LinkedIn bio + placeholder sections)

3. **Proposed enhanced structure:**
   - Vision (5-year north star)
   - Current Role (scope, stakeholders, focus)
   - Timeline (career history)
   - Growth (skills inventory)
   - Network (sponsors, mentors, advisors)
   - Wins & Artifacts
   - Open Tasks

### Phase 3: Coaching Conversation (One Question at a Time)

4. **Vision** — Asked "What does 2031 look like if you're fulfilled?"
   - Captured: work-life balance, CTO-level role, teaching/publishing, global travel with partner
   - Confirmed and updated

5. **Current Role** — Asked about scope, stakeholders, transition
   - Captured: 8 direct reports, ~65 org, ~$20M budget
   - Key insight: transitioning from Delivery to Architecture + Innovation
   - West CIO taking operational responsibilities

6. **Timeline** — User provided LinkedIn history
   - Built full 20+ year career arc
   - Identified pattern: DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture → CTO

7. **Network** — Asked about sponsors, mentors, advisors
   - Clarified the difference between the three
   - Captured 4 sponsors, 2 mentors, 5 advisors, 1 mentee

8. **Wins** — Asked for 2024-2025 highlights
   - GAS Summit (3 years running)
   - GCC expansion (Chennai → Trivandrum)
   - AI expert brand established
   - IDEO certification, MIT program

### Phase 4: Blind Spot Analysis

9. **Reviewed Career Index holistically** — Asked "What's missing?"

   Identified 6 gaps:
   - Innovation Thesis (no POV articulated)
   - External Visibility (everything internal to Lockton)
   - Business Impact Metrics (no $ values)
   - Transition Success Criteria (undefined)
   - External Sponsors (all internal)
   - 2026 Theme (too many priorities)

10. **Added new sections:**
    - 2026 Theme ("Visible outside Lockton")
    - Innovation Thesis + Portfolio + Failure Log
    - External Visibility Plan (speaking, writing pipelines)
    - Business Impact Metrics
    - Risk Register
    - Restructured Open Tasks by category

### Phase 5: Goal Cascade

11. **Created [[2026 Goals]]** — Separate note with:
    - 3 Annual Goals (G1: Visibility, G2: Innovation, G3: Transition)
    - Quarterly Intentions (Q1-Q4)
    - Monthly Milestones
    - Weekly Review Questions
    - Progress Tracker

12. **Adjusted timeline** — West CIO hasn't started yet; moved handoff to Mar-Apr

### Phase 6: Full Circle Areas Framework (Session 2)

13. **Created [[0_Areas_Index]]** — Life areas master document based on Jamie's "Full Circle" framework from [[2026 Vision and Intentions.pdf]]

14. **Restructured vault folders** — Renamed all 8 Area folders and index files to match Jamie's naming:
    - Health → Health – Mind, Body & Spirit
    - Relationships → Relationships & Social Life
    - Career → Career & Purpose
    - Finance → Finances & Security
    - Learning → Education & Learning
    - Recreation → Joy, Creativity & Play
    - Environment → Home & Environment
    - Contribution → Contribution & Legacy

15. **Word of the Year** — Chose "Emergence"
    - *Stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself*
    - Jamie's word: "Abundance"

16. **Anticipated Moments** — Built 2026 milestone tables:
    - Birthdays & Milestones (EJ graduation, college, family birthdays)
    - Career & Learning (GAI NYC, London GEA, MIT residency, conferences)
    - Travel & Joy (NYC, London together, India + Dubai)

17. **Area Intentions** — Started Jamie-style coaching to personalize each area
    - Completed: Health – Mind, Body & Spirit
    - *"Transforming my body to be lean and energized, sharpening focus and clarity, grounding in mindfulness over materialism"*
    - Remaining 7 areas: captured placeholder intentions

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 2026 Theme: "Visible outside Lockton" | Internal credibility established; external is the gap |
| One question at a time | Allows depth, confirmation, iteration |
| Separate 2026 Goals note | Keeps Career Index strategic, goals tactical |
| Added Risk Register | CTO path isn't guaranteed; need contingencies |
| Adopt Jamie's Full Circle naming exactly | Shared framework, aligned language, reinforces partnership |
| Word of the Year: "Emergence" | Captures the transition from internal → external, credibility → visibility |
| Jamie-style coaching for intentions | Personal, grounded; not generic corporate language |

---

## Frameworks Used

1. **Career Index Structure** — Vision → Role → Timeline → Growth → Network → Wins → Tasks
2. **Sponsor/Mentor/Advisor distinction** — Different relationship types serve different purposes
3. **Goal Cascade** — Vision → Annual Goals → Quarterly Intentions → Monthly Milestones → Weekly Actions
4. **Blind Spot Analysis** — Review holistically, identify gaps, add missing sections
5. **One Question at a Time** — Confirm before updating, iterate in small batches
6. **Full Circle Framework** — Jamie's 8 interconnected life areas; no part exists in a vacuum
7. **Word of the Year** — Single word that captures the year's theme and north star
8. **Anticipated Moments** — Milestones to experience with presence and gratitude

## Meta Observations

**What worked well:**
- One question at a time → deeper answers, better quality
- Confirm before updating → builds trust, catches errors
- Blind spot analysis after completion → reveals gaps you miss in the weeds
- Separate strategic (Career Index) from tactical (2026 Goals)
- Grounding in partner's framework (Full Circle) creates shared language
- Word of the Year anchors all intentions to a single theme
- Jamie-style coaching → personal, not corporate

**What to improve:**
- Could have asked about business impact metrics earlier
- Innovation Thesis is the linchpin — should have pushed harder on it
- Session 2 could have continued through all 8 area intentions in one go
