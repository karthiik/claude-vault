# Career Coaching Session — Jan 17, 2026

**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Focus:** Career Index buildout + 2026 goal setting
**Output:** [[0_Career_Index]], [[2026 Goals]]

---

## Session Objective

Build a comprehensive Career Index from scratch, then cascade into actionable 2026 goals.

---

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Foundation (CLAUDE.md Setup)

1. **User Preferences** — Built out profile section in [[CLAUDE.md]]
   - Professional context (role, industry, expertise)
   - Communication preferences
   - How to help / things to avoid

### Phase 2: Career Index Structure

2. **Analyzed existing note** — Started with basic Career Index (LinkedIn bio + placeholder sections)

3. **Proposed enhanced structure:**
   - Vision (5-year north star)
   - Current Role (scope, stakeholders, focus)
   - Timeline (career history)
   - Growth (skills inventory)
   - Network (sponsors, mentors, advisors)
   - Wins & Artifacts
   - Open Tasks

### Phase 3: Coaching Conversation (One Question at a Time)

4. **Vision** — Asked "What does 2031 look like if you're fulfilled?"
   - Captured: work-life balance, CTO-level role, teaching/publishing, global travel with partner
   - Confirmed and updated

5. **Current Role** — Asked about scope, stakeholders, transition
   - Captured: 8 direct reports, ~65 org, ~$20M budget
   - Key insight: transitioning from Delivery to Architecture + Innovation
   - West CIO taking operational responsibilities

6. **Timeline** — User provided LinkedIn history
   - Built full 20+ year career arc
   - Identified pattern: DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture → CTO

7. **Network** — Asked about sponsors, mentors, advisors
   - Clarified the difference between the three
   - Captured 4 sponsors, 2 mentors, 5 advisors, 1 mentee

8. **Wins** — Asked for 2024-2025 highlights
   - GAS Summit (3 years running)
   - GCC expansion (Chennai → Trivandrum)
   - AI expert brand established
   - IDEO certification, MIT program

### Phase 4: Blind Spot Analysis

9. **Reviewed Career Index holistically** — Asked "What's missing?"

   Identified 6 gaps:
   - Innovation Thesis (no POV articulated)
   - External Visibility (everything internal to Lockton)
   - Business Impact Metrics (no $ values)
   - Transition Success Criteria (undefined)
   - External Sponsors (all internal)
   - 2026 Theme (too many priorities)

10. **Added new sections:**
    - 2026 Theme ("Visible outside Lockton")
    - Innovation Thesis + Portfolio + Failure Log
    - External Visibility Plan (speaking, writing pipelines)
    - Business Impact Metrics
    - Risk Register
    - Restructured Open Tasks by category

### Phase 5: Goal Cascade

11. **Created [[2026 Goals]]** — Separate note with:
    - 3 Annual Goals (G1: Visibility, G2: Innovation, G3: Transition)
    - Quarterly Intentions (Q1-Q4)
    - Monthly Milestones
    - Weekly Review Questions
    - Progress Tracker

12. **Adjusted timeline** — West CIO hasn't started yet; moved handoff to Mar-Apr

---

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 2026 Theme: "Visible outside Lockton" | Internal credibility established; external is the gap |
| One question at a time | Allows depth, confirmation, iteration |
| Separate 2026 Goals note | Keeps Career Index strategic, goals tactical |
| Added Risk Register | CTO path isn't guaranteed; need contingencies |

---

## Frameworks Used

1. **Career Index Structure** — Vision → Role → Timeline → Growth → Network → Wins → Tasks
2. **Sponsor/Mentor/Advisor distinction** — Different relationship types serve different purposes
3. **Goal Cascade** — Vision → Annual Goals → Quarterly Intentions → Monthly Milestones → Weekly Actions
4. **Blind Spot Analysis** — Review holistically, identify gaps, add missing sections
5. **One Question at a Time** — Confirm before updating, iterate in small batches

---

## Artifacts Created

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Career Index (enhanced) | [[0_Career_Index]] |
| 2026 Goals | [[2026 Goals]] |
| User Preferences | [[CLAUDE.md#User Preferences]] |
| This session log | [[2026-01-17 Career Coaching Session]] |

---

## Open Threads for Future Sessions

- [ ] Draft Innovation Thesis (answer the 3 prompt questions)
- [ ] Identify speaking/podcast targets
- [ ] Quantify business impact ($$ for GCC, budget optimization, etc.)
- [ ] Build out other Areas (Health, Finance, Learning, etc.)

---

## Meta Observations

**What worked well:**
- One question at a time → deeper answers, better quality
- Confirm before updating → builds trust, catches errors
- Blind spot analysis after completion → reveals gaps you miss in the weeds
- Separate strategic (Career Index) from tactical (2026 Goals)

**What to improve:**
- Could have asked about business impact metrics earlier
- Innovation Thesis is the linchpin — should have pushed harder on it
