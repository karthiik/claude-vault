---

## Session Objective

Build a comprehensive Life Areas master document based on Jamie's "Full Circle" framework, then personalize each area through coaching.

---

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Areas Index Creation

1. **Created [[0_Areas_Index]]** — Master document for 8 life areas based on [[2026 Vision and Intentions.pdf]]

2. **Restructured vault folders** — Renamed all Area folders and index files to match Jamie's naming exactly:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| Health | Health – Mind, Body & Spirit |
| Relationships | Relationships & Social Life |
| Career | Career & Purpose |
| Finance | Finances & Security |
| Learning | Education & Learning |
| Recreation | Joy, Creativity & Play |
| Environment | Home & Environment |
| Contribution | Contribution & Legacy |

3. **Updated [[CLAUDE.md]]** — Reflected new Area structure in vault documentation

### Phase 2: Word of the Year

4. **Chose "Emergence"** — After considering options, landed on:
   - *Stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself*
   - *Emerging from internal credibility to external impact*
   - *Rising into the CTO chapter while staying grounded in what matters*

5. **Noted Jamie's word:** "Abundance" — *we rise together, each in our own way*

### Phase 3: Anticipated Moments

6. **Built 2026 milestone tables** organized by category:

   **Birthdays & Milestones:**
   - Logan's 23rd (Jan 3), Karthik's 48th (Jan 31)
   - Vinay turns 15 (Mar 30), EJ's birthday (Apr 23)
   - EJ graduating high school (May 18), starting college (August)
   - Jamie's birthday (Aug 14)

   **Career & Learning:**
   - GAI NYC (Jan 28), London GEA Kickoff (Feb)
   - MIT CTO Program residency (April), graduation (TBD)
   - External conference target (TBD)
   - Jamie: HR Tech speaking (Mar 15), Digital Connect Insurance (Aug 18-20)

   **Travel & Joy:**
   - NYC birthday trip (Jan 28-31)
   - London trip together (Apr 24 – May 8)
   - India + Dubai trip with EJ (Summer)

### Phase 4: Area Intentions (In Progress)

7. **Started Jamie-style coaching** to personalize each area's intention statement

   **Completed:**
   - ✅ **Health – Mind, Body & Spirit:** "Transforming my body to be lean and energized, sharpening focus and clarity, grounding in mindfulness over materialism"

   **Remaining (placeholder intentions captured):**
   - ⏳ Relationships & Social Life
   - ⏳ Career & Purpose
   - ⏳ Finances & Security
   - ⏳ Education & Learning
   - ⏳ Joy, Creativity & Play
   - ⏳ Home & Environment
   - ⏳ Contribution & Legacy

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Adopt Jamie's Full Circle naming exactly | Shared framework, aligned language, reinforces partnership |
| Word of the Year: "Emergence" | Captures the transition from internal → external, credibility → visibility |
| Jamie-style coaching for intentions | Personal, grounded; not generic corporate language |
| Separate session logs by area | Easier to load focused context for future sessions |

---

## Frameworks Used

1. **Full Circle Framework** — Jamie's 8 interconnected life areas; no part exists in a vacuum
2. **Word of the Year** — Single word that captures the year's theme and north star
3. **Anticipated Moments** — Milestones to experience with presence and gratitude
4. **One Question at a Time** — Confirm before updating, iterate in small batches
5. **Jamie-style Coaching** — Questions framed as if Jamie is asking, personal and grounded

- Word of the Year anchors all intentions to a single theme
