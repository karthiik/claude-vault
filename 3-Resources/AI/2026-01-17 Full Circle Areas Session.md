## Session Objective

Build a comprehensive Life Areas master document based on Jamie's "Full Circle" framework, then personalize each area through coaching.

---

## What We Did

### Phase 1: Areas Index Creation

1. **Created [[0_Areas_Index]]** — Master document for 8 life areas based on [[2026 Vision and Intentions.pdf]]

2. **Restructured vault folders** — Renamed all Area folders and index files to match Jamie's naming exactly:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| Health | Health – Mind, Body & Spirit |
| Relationships | Relationships & Social Life |
| Career | Career & Purpose |
| Finance | Finances & Security |
| Learning | Education & Learning |
| Recreation | Joy, Creativity & Play |
| Environment | Home & Environment |
| Contribution | Contribution & Legacy |

3. **Updated [[CLAUDE.md]]** — Reflected new Area structure in vault documentation

### Phase 2: Word of the Year

4. **Chose "Emergence"** — After considering options, landed on:
   - *Stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself*
   - *Emerging from internal credibility to external impact*
   - *Rising into the CTO chapter while staying grounded in what matters*

5. **Noted Jamie's word:** "Abundance" — *we rise together, each in our own way*

### Phase 3: Anticipated Moments

6. **Built 2026 milestone tables** organized by category:

   **Birthdays & Milestones:**
   - Logan's 23rd (Jan 3), Karthik's 48th (Jan 31)
   - Vinay turns 15 (Mar 30), EJ's birthday (Apr 23)
   - EJ graduating high school (May 18), starting college (August)
   - Jamie's birthday (Aug 14)

   **Career & Learning:**
   - GAI NYC (Jan 28), London GEA Kickoff (Feb)
   - MIT CTO Program residency (April), graduation (TBD)
   - External conference target (TBD)
   - Jamie: HR Tech speaking (Mar 15), Digital Connect Insurance (Aug 18-20)

   **Travel & Joy:**
   - NYC birthday trip (Jan 28-31)
   - London trip together (Apr 24 – May 8)
   - India + Dubai trip with EJ (Summer)

### Phase 4: Area Intentions (Complete)

7. **Completed Jamie-style coaching** to personalize all 8 area intention statements:

   - ✅ **Health – Mind, Body & Spirit:** Transforming body, sharpening focus, grounding in mindfulness
   - ✅ **Relationships & Social Life:** Vinay looking up to him, showing up for Jamie, work-family balance
   - ✅ **Career & Purpose:** AI thought leader balancing optimism with realism, deep sense of purpose
   - ✅ **Finances & Security:** Freedom at 55-60, travel, passion projects, legacy for Vinay
   - ✅ **Education & Learning:** Well-rounded leader, clear communication, empathy, presence, best self
   - ✅ **Joy, Creativity & Play:** Aliveness through team problem-solving, motorcycling, nature
   - ✅ **Home & Environment:** Creativity, healthy living, safe haven for Vinay, Jamie's home too
   - ✅ **Contribution & Legacy:** Sharing learnings, futurist vision, inspiration for Vinay

### Phase 5: Guiding Principles (Complete)

8. **Personalized "Principles to Carry Forward"** — Replaced Jamie's framework principles with Karthik's own lessons learned through coaching:

   - ✅ **Trust Your Gut** — intuition as compass, don't overthink
   - ✅ **Choose You First** — peace over people-pleasing
   - ✅ **Decide and Move** — confidence, no second-guessing
   - ✅ **Journal for Clarity** — mindfulness through writing
   - ✅ **Practice Gratitude** — abundance mindset
   - ✅ **Break the Pattern** — health accountability (don't repeat past slips)

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Adopt Jamie's Full Circle naming exactly | Shared framework, aligned language, reinforces partnership |
| Word of the Year: "Emergence" | Captures the transition from internal → external, credibility → visibility |
| Jamie-style coaching for intentions | Personal, grounded; not generic corporate language |
| Personalize guiding principles | Jamie's framework principles replaced with Karthik's own lessons learned |
| Separate session logs by area | Easier to load focused context for future sessions |

---

## Frameworks Used

1. **Full Circle Framework** — Jamie's 8 interconnected life areas; no part exists in a vacuum
2. **Word of the Year** — Single word that captures the year's theme and north star
3. **Anticipated Moments** — Milestones to experience with presence and gratitude
4. **One Question at a Time** — Confirm before updating, iterate in small batches
5. **Jamie-style Coaching** — Questions framed as if Jamie is asking, personal and grounded

- Jamie-style coaching → personal, not corporate
- Anticipated Moments makes the year feel real and grounded
