# Career Coaching Methodology

A repeatable framework for AI-assisted career planning and goal setting.

---

## Overview

This methodology transforms a basic career note into a comprehensive strategic planning system through structured conversation and iterative refinement.

**Time required:** 45-90 minutes for initial buildout
**Output:** Career Index + Annual Goals cascade
**Best for:** Professionals seeking clarity on career direction, executives preparing for next-level roles

---

## The Process

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

**Goal:** Establish context so the AI can be a useful partner.

1. **Create/update CLAUDE.md (or equivalent system file)**
   - Profile: Name, location, timezone
   - Professional context: Role, industry, expertise
   - Communication preferences: Tone, depth, format
   - How to help: What kind of assistance is most valuable
   - Things to avoid: Pet peeves, anti-patterns

**Why this matters:** The AI needs to understand who you are to give non-generic advice.

---

### Phase 2: Career Index Structure

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive career document with the right sections.

**Core sections:**

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Vision | 5-year north star — where you're heading |
| Annual Theme | One focus for this year |
| Current Role | Scope, stakeholders, current focus |
| Timeline | Career history — the arc |
| Growth | Skills inventory + development plan |
| Innovation Thesis | Your POV on your industry |
| Network | Sponsors, mentors, advisors, mentees |
| External Visibility | Speaking, writing, brand-building |
| Wins & Artifacts | Achievements with proof points |
| Business Impact | $$ value of your work |
| Risk Register | Career contingencies |
| Open Tasks | Actionable items |

**Tip:** Start with whatever exists. Enhance section by section.

---

### Phase 3: Coaching Conversation

**Goal:** Fill in each section through structured dialogue.

**The method: One Question at a Time**

```
Ask question → Receive answer → Confirm understanding → Update file → Move to next
```

**Why this works:**
- Depth over breadth — you get richer answers
- Confirmation catches misunderstandings early
- Small batches are easier to review
- Builds trust through iteration

**Sample questions by section:**

| Section | Question |
|---------|----------|
| Vision | "It's 5 years from now and you're fulfilled. What does that look like?" |
| Current Role | "What's your scope? Who are your key stakeholders?" |
| Timeline | "What were the key roles before this one? What did you learn in each?" |
| Network | "Who are your sponsors? (People who advocate for you when you're not in the room)" |
| Wins | "What are the 2-3 biggest achievements from the past 1-2 years?" |

**Definitions to clarify:**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Sponsor | Advocates for you when you're not in the room; has power/influence |
| Mentor | Gives advice based on experience; you pull from them |
| Advisor | Sounding board for specific decisions; mutual exchange |

---

### Phase 4: Blind Spot Analysis

**Goal:** Review the completed Career Index and identify what's missing.

**The method: Step back and critique**

After completing all sections, ask:
- "What's missing that should be front and center?"
- "What would a coach specializing in [your focus area] add?"
- "What are the gaps between where I am and where I want to be?"

**Common blind spots:**

| Blind Spot | Question to Surface It |
|------------|------------------------|
| No clear POV | "What do you believe about your industry that others don't?" |
| Internal-only visibility | "Who outside your company would recommend you for a role?" |
| No business metrics | "Can you quantify the $ impact of your wins?" |
| Too many priorities | "If this year had ONE theme, what would it be?" |
| No contingency | "What if your current path doesn't work out?" |

---

### Phase 5: Goal Cascade

**Goal:** Turn strategy into executable goals.

**The cascade:**

```
Vision (5-year)
    ↓
Annual Goals (2-3 outcomes)
    ↓
Quarterly Intentions (what each quarter is about)
    ↓
Monthly Milestones (checkpoints)
    ↓
Weekly Actions (what to do this week)
```

**Structure for Annual Goals:**

| Goal | Outcome | Success Metric | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| G1 | What you'll achieve | How you'll measure it | Not started / In progress / Complete |
| G2 | ... | ... | ... |
| G3 | ... | ... | ... |

**Quarterly Intentions:**

| Quarter | Intention | Focus |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Q1 | *"Stabilize the transition"* | [specific priorities] |
| Q2 | *"Build the thesis"* | [specific priorities] |
| Q3 | *"Go external"* | [specific priorities] |
| Q4 | *"Deliver and reflect"* | [specific priorities] |

**Weekly Review Questions:**
1. What's the ONE thing this week that moves me toward my goals?
2. Am I on track for this month's milestones?
3. What's blocking me? Who can help?
4. Am I protecting time for what matters?

---

### Phase 6: Maintenance

**Goal:** Keep the system alive.

**Cadence:**

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| Weekly | Review weekly questions, update task status |
| Monthly | Check milestones, adjust if needed |
| Quarterly | Review quarterly intention, plan next quarter |
| Annually | Full Career Index review, set next year's theme and goals |

**Session logs:** Document each coaching session for:
- What was discussed
- Decisions made
- Frameworks used
- Open threads

## Key Principles

1. **One question at a time** — Depth beats breadth
2. **Confirm before updating** — Builds trust, catches errors
3. **Separate strategic from tactical** — Career Index vs. Goals note
4. **Blind spot analysis** — Step back after completing to find gaps
5. **Cascade goals** — Vision → Year → Quarter → Month → Week
6. **Document the meta** — Session logs make the process repeatable
