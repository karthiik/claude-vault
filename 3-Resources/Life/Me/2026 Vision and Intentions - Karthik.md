# 2026 Vision

## The Word of the Year: Emergence

*Emergence is stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself. Emerging from internal credibility to external impact. Rising into the CTO chapter while staying grounded in what matters.*

## 2026 Beginning of Vision — Lessons to Carry Forward

*This is my initial view of 2026, built upon the hard-won insights of the past year; the intentions that follow are the map of how I will reach this vision.*

- **Trust Your Gut:** Intuition is my compass — listen for what truly fits rather than overthinking or forcing outcomes.
- **Choose You First:** Do what feels right to me, not what makes someone else happy. My peace matters.
- **Decide and Move:** Be confident in the decisions I make. Once decided, commit — don't rethink or second-guess.
- **Journal for Clarity:** Practice mindfulness by writing regularly. Processing thoughts on paper keeps me grounded and present.
- **Practice Gratitude:** Remember all that I have in my life. Gratitude shifts perspective from scarcity to abundance.
- **Break the Pattern:** I've let health slip before — eating, activity, strength. Name it, remember it, don't repeat it this year.

# 2026 Full Circle Intentions: A Path to Emergence

</div>

*The "Full Circle" approach is the realization that no part of my life exists in a vacuum. My health underpins my career; my career provides the security for my home; my home is the sanctuary for my relationships; and my relationships fuel my joy. By nurturing each of these eight areas with equal intentionality, I move away from a life of "fragmented effort" and into a life of "harmonious flow." This integration is what creates true Emergence — stepping into visibility across every dimension of life.*

### 🏃 Health – Mind, Body & Spirit

*I am transforming my body to be lean and energized, sharpening focus and clarity, and grounding in mindfulness over materialism.*

- **Body:** Achieve AT Ready by 50 — hike 100 miles of Appalachian Trail before turning 50 (Jan 2028)
- **Continue rucking 2-3x/week** with progressive weight increase; add weight training 2-3x/week
- **Mind:** Shift from 95% consumption to creation over consumption — mornings are for building, not scrolling
- **Spirit:** Cultivate contentment regardless of circumstance — happy with more, happy with less
- **Eat less salty/restaurant food** — meal prep weekly, pre-stock fridge before travel returns
- **Add evening ritual** — AI-assisted quick reflection in Obsidian to close the day intentionally
