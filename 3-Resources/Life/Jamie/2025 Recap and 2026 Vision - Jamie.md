## 2025: The Word of the Year

> **Redemption**

*In 2025, I was redeemed not by erasing the accident, but by processing it. I asked the Universe for redemption and happiness in January; by December, I saw myself as "normal again — changed but grounded".*

---

## Year Summary & Key Memories

2025 was the year I reintegrated into my own life. I will likely remember:

- **The WIL National Leadership Event** — The moment my "recovery story" became a source of public empowerment
- **The Accident Anniversary** — Transforming a day of trauma into a "backyard party" with baton trophies, signaling a shift from memorialization to celebration
- **The Return to the Kitchen** — Reclaiming the joy of cooking and shared meals, which signaled that I no longer felt "fight or flight"
- **A Family Dog** — Welcoming Skai to the family; giving and receiving so much love

---

## Themes & Patterns

Across all areas of life, several core themes emerged consistently throughout the year:

| Theme | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| **Mind-Body-Spirit Connection** | Mental anxiety was deeply intertwined with physical symptoms like neck tightness and blood pressure. Progress in one area often depended on attention to another. |
| **Intentional Pacing** | Moved from "slower pace" in January to "quiet momentum" in July. Consistently prioritized "alignment over speed". |
| **Vulnerability as Leadership** | Sharing my recovery story publicly marked a major turning point, shifting my identity from victim to leader of "human experience". |
| **Environment as Sanctuary** | Home was a consistent "sanctuary" and "safe space" for healing. Upgrading HVAC directly supported my voice. |
| **Reclaiming Rhythms** | Joy was found in the return of "old days" feelings — NICA races, family trips, and concerts. |

## What to Leave in 2025

To move into 2026 fully, these narratives and habits have served their purpose and can now be retired:

- ❌ The "Demoted" label at work
- ❌ Fear that others see me as "disabled" after the accident
- ❌ Shrinking / Fear of Rejection
- ❌ Victimhood and identity defined solely by trauma
- ❌ Control & Perfectionism — especially regarding voice and relationship outcomes

---

## Lessons to Carry Forward into 2026

These are the insights gained from both the "flowing" and "stuck" moments of 2025:

1. **Intuition is the Compass** — Trust my gut and "listen for what truly fits" rather than forcing outcomes
2. **Boundaries Protect Peace** — Maintaining distance from toxic behaviors is essential for nervous system regulation
3. **Presence Over Perfection** — Choosing to be present in my body, even with its limitations, allows me to welcome happiness
4. **The Power of Ritual** — Rituals (old and new) help process trauma and celebrate milestones
