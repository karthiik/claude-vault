Based on the webpage and screenshot you provided, **IB** stands for the **International Baccalaureate**, specifically the **Diploma Programme (DP)** offered at Coppell High School.

It is a rigorous, two-year pre-university educational program that students typically register for during their sophomore (10th grade) year to complete during their junior and senior years.

According to the "10 Reasons" graphic on the right side of your screen, the program is designed to be "ideal preparation for university" by offering the following benefits:

- **University Preparation:** It is an internationally recognized qualification that increases academic opportunities.
    
- **Critical Thinking:** It encourages students to analyze and evaluate issues rather than just memorizing facts.
    
- **Global Mindset:** It aims to create "globally minded" graduates who understand complex international issues.
    
- **Holistic Growth:** Students are encouraged to develop emotionally and ethically, not just academically ("care about more than just results").
    
- **Independence:** It trains students to become confident, independent learners.
    

**Who is this for?** The text on the page indicates this specific portal is currently focused on **10th graders** and their families who are considering registering for the program for the 2026-27 school year.
