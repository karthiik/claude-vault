# Goals Reference — Universal Naming System

> Master reference for all 2026 goals with universal IDs. Use these codes in Things 3 project names and Obsidian links for seamless cross-referencing.

---

## How This Works

**In Things 3:** Name projects with the goal code prefix
- Example: `C1: External Visibility Q1`

**In Obsidian:** Reference goals with the same codes
- Example: `Working on [[Goals-Reference#C1]] this week`

**In Daily Notes:** Goal reminders use these codes
- Example: `G1 Visibility: What moves you toward being known outside Lockton today?`
