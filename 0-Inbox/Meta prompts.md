Barbara Minto McKinsey Pyramid prompt 

For Restructuring Research Using the Pyramid Principle

Prompt:

Take the following research and restructure it using Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle. Begin with the single most important conclusion or recommendation-the one thing the reader must know if they read nothing else. Then group supporting arguments into no more than three to five major themes, each with its own clear point. Under each theme, provide the specific evidence and data that supports it. Ensure every piece of information answers "why?" or

"how?" for the point above it. Remove any information that does not directly support the main conclusion. The final structure should allow an executive to stop reading at any level and still have a complete, actionable understanding.
