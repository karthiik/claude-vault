Summarize this 

### Byron - On Insurance markets 

Many claims is what we had before. I should get a reduction in rate so the carriers, they want the business. That really impacts the brokers. The brokers make their money in a couple different ways:

- commissions, which is a percentage of the premium we sell

- fees, these are in terms of services that we offer back to the client

When the rates go down the overall premium goes down as well. We don't make so much money so they call that a soft market across the industry. Clients are willing to do more shopping around to get a better rate because they're seeing ubiquity in terms of what brokers and carriers offer.

That goes back to one of your foreclosures: how do you differentiate yourself? How do you make it so that you can keep the rate flat and explain to the clients that here's all the other stuff that we do for you? You have to change the business. It's no longer an insurance document, a policy, or whatever. It's all about the conversation and the extra things that you bring to the table, which requires brokers to reinvent themselves. We're always looking for ways to do process automation, different things, to be able to do that.

That leads to the third bullet: clients are expecting better analytics. They're expecting structuring segments so you look at you can sell a work comp policy, sell a general liability policy, but you have to double click in each one of those to get specific about what needs to be covered by the clients. They're not looking at the broad umbrella anymore. They're looking at layering different capabilities within the insurance portfolio. In order to do that you got to look at the structure of what they're trying to ensure, the structure of the risk, and make sure that that's covered, and you got a segment by industry affinity, local markets.

I mentioned some Korean does not like to have their risk placed in Singapore or India; they want to stay internal to the country. That's a nationalistic sort of mindset, especially given the geopolitical things going on right now. You have to at least lead with a local carrier. They're willing to structure layer the risk with other carriers but if you lead with other carriers outside the country and some other broker comes in and says, 'You know what, we found a carrier in country that's gonna cover that primary risk for you,' they're gonna win the deal. You got to be smart enough. You have to have the relationships in country to be able to do that. In some parts, like KSA (Saudi), you have to use that. There's an affinity to local markets.

We talked a little bit about this: high regulatory and supervisory intensity across the globe. You've got NYDFS here in the United States. You got the California Consumer Protection things that you have to do to the lowest common denominator in those spaces. The European Union GDPR, you've got India regulation, you got Singapore banking rules. You got all sorts of different things that you've got to deal with, then you have nation states that you have to deal with, like China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, that you have to apply for to the lowest common denominator.

Those are the themes that not only just technology groups are looking at in challenging brokers but just in general these are the things that are guiding us. How do we create a business operation model that is scalable and flexible to be able to change on a dime if we need to? What does that look like?

Advisory: as I mentioned clients are willing to; they want to understand what they're getting for their dollar in terms of from their broker. We have to change ourselves not to be found an insurance carrier to cover you. We have to be a lot smarter about advising them on different things that are going on inside of their organization, especially if you're a global brand. If your global focus, you have to have the capability. I always use this in our specialty space marine. Okay you've got these big shipping 

Eriana, and how best to ensure that that's where the structured piece comes into play, but that's the advisory. That's what clients are looking mostly for.

Program Engineering, so layering, so there's the top risk and then there's the layers below it that you don't necessarily want to go with one carrier. You have to be smart about it in the insurance, where we have these mud maps. Mud maps were very static up to a couple of years ago and now they're dynamic, based on the claims, based on the type of risk that you want to put in place. You have to be able to layer those across the different companies and industries.

You mentioned South America. South America is huge in the mining so you have to know that the claims are higher in Lima, Peru, than they are in Brazil. Why? Because the regulatory bodies are a lot stronger in Brazil. That means that there are fewer claims than there are in Lima. There's also more catastrophe that happens there, which means you're paying out more in that space. You have to layer appropriately and look into each one.

Mining companies cross country boundaries so you have to make sure that you're covering all of those different mines that are across South America.

Data quality is table stakes to be able to do the advisory piece. You have to have the data on the fleets for the different shipping. You have to have the census information on the employee base and it can't just be one country. If you're thinking about KSA and the Middle East, you've got all sorts of different census information in different countries, different regulations that you have to comply with. You've got to be smart enough to advise your company, your client, in the right pieces and parts to solve. This gets back to the agent piece.

Operational excellence. Insurance, the old rule of writing a policy and going down and putting his specific endorsements and pieces and parts in the document, eventually is going to fade away because AI; that's a perfect job for AI. The whole underwriting function that goes on with creating the policy, you can throw tons and tons of data at an AI engine and get it so that you're going to get consistent results over time. That piece is going to go away so then the other components are going to become more prevalent. The advisory, the data quality, all of those instances are going to be at the forefront.

Right now it's just part of; you have got to do it but that is going to be where you're going to sell your clients on the whole advisory function. A piece that a lot of brokers will miss is that in order to give your client the best possible recommendation, you have to understand their business. You have to understand their industry and you have to understand their affordability. Understanding their industry is not only just understanding the business but also the capital markets that support them. You have to understand what's going on globally because most of these organizations that you're selling to, you have to look at the Hang Seng. You have to look at the Indian stock market. You have to look at the London stock market. You have to look at all of the capital environments that are causing pressure or giving up and understand where they are financially in their markets because they look at the business of risk in terms of financial markets these days.

Do I self-insure? Do I take a bucket of money and I put it aside and I put it in an annuity or something like that and I'm going to cover my claims? Or do I do something else? You have to be smart enough as a broker to understand that might be better for the client and that's the advisory piece. If you don't understand the capital markets and all of the different pieces and parts, then you're not a good advisor for your client.

That's how Lockton sees the markets across the globe and the different pieces and parts that we are putting in place are helping us scale to be able to embrace this and to be able to do it with confidence for our clients.

The last thing, data quality, that will torpedo a deal is if something is wrong. They get together and they go, you know 

It's a specialist. It's all about years that gets clients convinced that they should buy from us and then in the local markets that we operate in, we have specialists there that actually go and sell. They will sit in front because they know the local culture; culture is hugely important in the industry.

When we opened up, you mentioned India, so we traded through a partner probably three years ago, I think it was, and then we bought a CEO, an established person that was in the insurance industry like 20+ years. Then we built a company around him and then he had the back office infrastructure of people who were specialists between London and the United States to help him establish that organization, so we use the term "think global, act global". This is what differentiates us from some of your other clients in the broker space; they think global, act global. We're not akin to that philosophy. We believe that in words you have to be the customer where the customer is at, especially when you talk about Saudi Arabia. We're opening, I think, Canada and Canadians hate Americans right now. It's just not a climate and trying to get a CEO to be very thoughtful about the reporting structures and whatnot, so we have London. We had an office in Paris, so working for a European company is much better than working for an American-led one. Messaging is important, even though we're a global company, about how that structure is going to be in place, so we have teams locally and then they are. We have a massive global retailer that basically they called in through the number, and this is a household name that you all know about. We marshaled groups from around the globe that had specific knowledges of the different capabilities to be able to pitch the deal, to go to the finalist meeting with a pitch. We had people fly in from around the world. We're going to be able to do that and that's the benefit of how we operate: it's not a particular; there's a lead obviously but then wherever the skills are that we need, sure, and multiple men, so it's helpful. It's very flexible; it makes a ton of sense, yeah, makes it very fun. 

Asia, Pacific, Middle East: these are the different offices that we have and we're continuing to open up. One of our emerging markets is the Middle East and North Africa. You'll see some movement over the next five years and increasing that footprint in that region. That's why it's a big deal. We grow about 10% every year. I'll put you some numbers. It's about 13% CAGR, pretty decent, but the international operation is a lot of our growth, you see?

When I first started at Lockton it was a $600 million business. It's now a $1 billion US, which is huge. It's absolutely huge so we made some strategic investments in that. We also have a reinsurance footprint. When I started back in 2018, 2019, that business was $30 million US. Now it is close to $400 million in revenue, but we made a $15-20 million investment to be able to grow that.

Byron, do you have a leader for each of the blue new? We do. The way that each of the blue is broken down, there's a CEO, there is a COO, and there's usually an IT component. Some of those are directly aligned to my organization and some of those are aligned to leadership in country. All of them, Lockton is an organization where you manage by influence and relationship. You've got to have the ability, if you're a bull in the China closet, but we have been able with this group of people to accomplish over the last five, six years that has been astronomical together and have a global entity for IT for technology. Five years ago we would've never talked about everybody being an Azure tenant or an old Azure tenant. We would've never talked about Saudi Arabia or Turkey or the UK but now everybody's in common with this sort of environment alignment, which is really good for us.

If you look at the business model, I mentioned 13% organic growth. We have 94 and this is key, 94% client loyalty. One of the things about brokers is it's all about the renewal, all about the renewal. Very similar to your presentation. 

### Byron - Lockton Business Model 

So what's the secret sauce of Lockton? It's not the secret sauce. It's all about hiring the right people. It's not, I would love to say, it's technology. It's not technology. It's all about getting the right people steered in the right direction to accomplish what the client needs and then what the client needs is unique based on the market that they needed. You have to understand that we don't believe in one size fits all. We have policy administration systems for our countries. We don't have one policy administration for all of our countries that we operate in.

It would be really great as the global CIO to say, 'Yeah all the data is in one,' but our business was up. So we have policy administrations for South America. We have policy administrations for Asia, for Pacific, for UK, et cetera. Now the key for us is, back to my initial comments around data and analytics, I have to be able to get that data out so I can do analytics. How are associates put that data in? I don't care. I just need to be able to get it out and that's the key for us so we don't lose sight of that. We focus on what's important to be able to do the things that we need to do to compete in the marketplace.

Private and independent people, I think I get asked often about if Lockton is going to sell. There are five people. They can make billions of dollars if they would sell, especially right now with the multiples the way they are in the broker space. A lot of consolidations are going on. They have no desire to sell.

So the fundamental difference with family is they are pro-producers. They're sales people. Every single one of them has a book of business. Ron Lockton has a $15 million book of business so he still needs to meet his customers. If our data center is melting and he gets a call from his customers, he is not going to care about the data center. He's going to go meet with this client. That's his mindset and that's where he focuses and all of them are the same mindset. They expect that mindset across every one of us around servicing the client and making it easier for a client so he doesn't want to change that. He feels that it's his job to make sure that that flag gets carried to the next generation to be able to perpetuate that.

Client focused, I already mentioned flat structured, 20-30% more invested in front end client services. The family puts forth their profits to reinvest in the business. They just don't take it and buy new stuff for themselves. They reinvest it, the reinsurance, moving from $30 million to $400 million in revenue. That was because of the investment that they made collectively from their family office so it's a huge change.

This is the growth from Kager's so you're 20-15 to 4 billion. We grow at about half a billion every year so a billion every two years. From us we have to make sure that we're staying ahead of that, that we can scale not only the footprint that we have but we also have the headlights up to look into the future. What do they need to be able to sell in those areas and what are some of the dynamics in the footprints that we're looking at that we can ensure that we're making the right decisions?

This is our competition and you guys; I'm sure these are some of your clients. We're number nine. We're going to move in front of aftershare. A new entry into the market is Howden. I don't know if they're a client of yours but make sure their shit goes down. They're based in London. They have been given our international operation, some challenges, but now their entry into the US market and they're predominantly in the wholesale space so they have good connections into the London market if you're familiar with how the London market works. They're leveraging those connections to place risk on the London markets from the United States. We had some of our wholesale stuff there over the last couple of years that we were moving out to do others. The big behemoths, we have no desire to become a marsh; that is not our goal or an AOM. Their business model is very different. Arthur J Gallagher, they've done some acquisitions and grown that way. You've got Willis, Lyon Hub, Brown and Brown, Akershire, and then 

Slow and steady. Take that hard time. When you look at so this is just another view of the insurance market over the 2034 so if you look at what these might be there's a lot of PE activity in the industry. PE firms usually want a return so we don't have that worry. We don't have the public worry we have five people are in it to win it and continue to grow that that's what the next how do we believe I think that still is still very much to be backed and continue to be PE backed. Can I ask a quick question on this? That might be a little provocative but did you see opportunity with the PE customers, PE companies to take customers? We do because here's why. So what PE wants what? They want a return right? They want a return. They're probably not servicing the clients like you would 100 percent. That's why I ask. So you're in a hard market. A soft market limited to sure if you're in a hard so so there's two opportunities in soft market the eyes are gonna go up and they're gonna say can I get a better deal? And our 94% retention rating we will undercut we won't make money we'll just give them it just give us for one year We can prove to them that we're better and nine times out of ten we seen on our feedback from our client surveys is my god I should have won with you sooner. Nine out of ten. 90 percent of them. So in a hard market then it's harder for the peanut butter spread companies to find a good price because they haven't focused on building relationships with the markets and with our markets on a global perspective we can offer that layering capability from a risk perspective. So we have our London markets we place a lot of our US risk on London markets from the United States and we have that capability so pure opportunity and so so Europe the the by the way and debacle. Mm-hmm kill yeah I mean if I were you really officer I'd be looking at this like I know exactly right that's why it's important to understand where the markets are sure not just for the insurance but also for your clients we're chasing a big customer right now that is with Martian and and it's all hands on deck. To be able to bring them over to us we just need four year you improve to them in a year and then you're not gonna get everything but get a piece and then we can grow that show the value of the momentum so billion dollars every 24 months We have a target that we expect ourselves to grow revenue growth 10% every year so as a producer as a salesperson as an organization supporting producers you got to be equipped and ready to go for that run so our fiscal is May 1 through April 30th and it is a big so we're at the tail end of our we're on the last half of our fiscal year it's all hands-on debt. absolutely all hands-on debt for us and there are cycles throughout the year one ones are massive because that's when renewals come up when a lot of our big companies fiscal years start on one two 1231 so from a 2031 revenue projections so United States will be around five billion International's gonna grow another two another billion so now we're gonna be seven seven billion dollars. And then the the staggering number I look at is the Associated. So we're going from 13,000 to 21,000 and most people you know they need to tech they need video they need all sorts of different things to be able to do their jobs they need the flexibility of technology and putting technology in different parts of the globe to be able to support that and they're looking to us and say alright what's the rules what's the regulations? What's the security pieces that we need to be thinking about across the globe. Quick question here. Yeah, sorry. No you're good. I see ten percent revenue 15. Yep. What role does technology play in that tell time? So we. 

**How do we create scalability across the organization? How do we not do everything differently? How do we scale?**

To be honest there are 18 different data centers across the globe. You walk into them and they have logos from every hardware provider out there. Sure that's hard.

We had a company in Lima, Peru. They have this cool AI capability and it only worked in the cloud so the cloud wasn't set up for them yet. We needed a solution to be able to deploy that. What did we do? We put it in the US tenant and we were able to use it from there.

Ubiquity is good at a certain level, to be able to provide that globally. Right now, two years ago, three years ago, you would have seen running around here; you would have seen a different logo on every single laptop. We had Max; we had everything in the world. Now we have the same global deal so now it is super easy for an associate online. The training is easy; everything is easy so IG's job is to remove the friction of technology, get rid of the friction of technology, but do it in a cost-constrained way. You don't have a blind check because if you do I do see AI being able to do all this massive data ingestion.

We have people; we have third parties that we hire to do data ingestion for us. AI is going to secure it totally. There are a number of different use cases and scenarios that we can apply that to, loss information. Imagine claims, medical claims. We have this massive highly secured database that has all these claims in it. Imagine a world where you can ask that database what's the most expensive claim, what's the highest use drunk, what's the surgery that goes bad most often. Imagine the power that you can then use and go back to advise your client on the things that: how do we avoid this? How do we change their work environment? They don't have to have the carpal tunnel surgery; they don't have to do different things. It's a lot cheaper; that's the advisory part. We should maybe put that one on our whiteboard of things to explore, along with data and gestation.

Yeah great, your process, and you have got to be very cool, like different modalities for claims. We have solutions around that. Insurance-specific claims are very easy; the problem is the policy and the endorsements. Sure, the word and ignore the big difference of coverage, right, and the AI has to be smart enough. There are a lot of claim solutions out there for ingestion but the sweet spot is being able to look at the endorsements because the endorsements are the structures inside those policies that are specific to the client and those specific risks that they want to cover. That's where it gets really interesting and you have to go. You've got to know the version of the document that it was written on. If it's not one compared to that two, it makes a massive change where there's a lot of exclusions. Comparison is huge and those are the big AI use cases.

Here's some policy in the AI world. It has to be 100% because it's a legal document and once that document is signed someone is accountable; somebody is liable. Errors and omissions become a big thing; errors and omissions become a massive deal so you have the AI; it's good.

Real quick time check: we've got a number out of here. I know we're right at 10:00 so let's wrap up and then we'll
