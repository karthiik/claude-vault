The One Thing\n**Execute Seattle travel flawlessly.** Your flight (AA 707, 7:10 AM) gets you to Redmond for the Microsoft visit. This trip is your informal pitch window with Byron for the Innovation Sprint (G2) — arrive prepared and rested.\n\n### 2. Calendar Shape\n- **Early morning:** Flight departure DFW → SEA (7:10 AM - 11:37 AM)\n- **Travel day:** No substantive meetings — use flight time for prep\n- **Note:** IT Daily Stand-Up is on calendar but you'll be airborne — likely won't attend\n\n### 3. Top 3 Priorities\n1. **Board the flight** — Check in, TSA, gate. Everything else is secondary.\n2. **Prepare Byron talking points** — Use flight time to refine your Innovation Sprint informal pitch; he wants business outcomes, not tech demos\n3. **Call Nav re: Puru promotion** — If possible before boarding; it's on your Things list\n\n### 4. Quick Win\n**Call Baylor** for pre-bloodwork scheduling (2/3 appointment) — 5 minutes while waiting at the gate.\n\n### 5. Watch Out\n**Ice storm risk** — You flagged Seattle flight concerns in Memory. Monitor flight status. Have a backup plan if delays cascade.\n\n---\n\n**Spark:** Travel is transition. Today you move from planning to presence — from thesis to pitch. *Emergence* isn't just an idea; it's showing up when it matters.",
