Here's your brief for **Tuesday, January 28, 2026**.\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 The One Thing\n**Pitch the Innovation Sprint to Byron informally during the Seattle/Redmond trip.** This is your window — you're together all day with dinner. Have the 2-minute pitch ready for drinks. Connects directly to G2 (Innovation Leadership) and G4 (Global EA Practice).\n\n---\n\n### 📅 Calendar Shape\n- **All-day:** Microsoft Executive Briefing in Redmond — meetings all day with dinner\n- **7:00 AM:** Sectionals (1 hour early block)\n- **IT Daily Stand Up** at some point\n\nThis is a **relationship and learning day**, not a heads-down execution day. Your brief windows are early morning and late evening.\n\n---\n\n### 🔺 Top 3 Priorities\n1. **Innovation Sprint pitch** — Have your informal 2-minute version ready for Byron over dinner or drinks\n2. **Synthesize Summit & Hackathon survey results** — Prep deck for Byron (he expects this + Innovation Sprint plan)\n3. **Promotion comms prep** — Target 2/1, Larry/Mark/Brooke — keep momentum\n\n---\n\n### ⚡ Quick Win\n**Call Nav on Puru promotion** — 10-minute call to close this loop. It's been sitting in open threads.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Watch Out\n**Don't let the Microsoft briefings consume all your mental energy.** The real work today is the Byron relationship — Microsoft content is context, not the deliverable. Stay engaged but preserve bandwidth for the informal Innovation Sprint conversation.\n\n---\n\n*\"Emergence happens at the edges — today you're at Microsoft with your CIO. The formal agenda is their AI journey; the real agenda is planting seeds for yours.\"*",
