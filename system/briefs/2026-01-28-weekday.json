The One Thing\n**Process the Microsoft Visit insights and prepare Byron deliverables.** Yesterday's Seattle trip was a wash, but Byron's team met in Redmond. Today you're virtual — use that distance strategically. Your job: capture decisions, synthesize action items, and advance the Innovation Sprint pitch (G2).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Calendar Shape\n- **All-day:** Microsoft Visit continues (Redmond) — you're joining virtually\n- **Morning:** NYC scheduling (Jamie prep for tomorrow)\n- **7:00-8:00 AM:** Sectionals + IT Daily Stand Up\n- **Rest of day:** Virtual participation in Microsoft sessions\n\nHeavy meeting day but virtual gives you flexibility between sessions.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Top 3 Priorities\n1. **Synthesize Microsoft Visit takeaways** — Document key conversations, decisions, action items from Byron/Glenn/TJ discussions\n2. **Advance Innovation Sprint pitch** — Use downtime between sessions to refine thesis and survey synthesis deck for Byron\n3. **NYC logistics** — Confirm Glenn/Claude trip booking (Things task)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Quick Win\n**Message Byron** — Quick check-in acknowledging travel chaos, confirming you're engaged virtually today. Keeps you visible despite the missed flight.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Watch Out\n**Virtual disconnect.** Being remote while the team is in-person means you need to proactively engage. Don't let the meeting notes write themselves — own the synthesis. Also: Fix that smoke detector tonight before it costs you another night of sleep.\n\n---\n\n**Spark:** The airport terminal taught you patience; today's virtual distance teaches you strategic positioning. Emergence isn't always about being in the room — sometimes it's about being the one who makes sense of what happened in it.",
