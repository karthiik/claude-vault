Here's your brief for **Monday, January 27, 2026**.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 The One Thing\n\n**Execute on the Microsoft/Byron face time in Seattle.** You're on the ground today — this is prime informal pitch territory for the Innovation Sprint. The thesis is done, the deadline is pushed to 2/7. Today's job: be present, build rapport, plant seeds before formal asks.\n\n---\n\n## 📅 Calendar Shape\n\n- **Microsoft Visit in Redmond** — All day meetings with Byron, Glenn, TJ, Brandon, Bret\n- **IT Daily Stand Up** — You'll likely miss or dial in briefly from Redmond\n- **DRC Dallas annual event** — Appears on calendar but you're in Seattle — delegate or note absence\n\nTravel recovery day. Yesterday was rough (ice storm delays, airport grind). Pace yourself — save energy for strategic conversations, not busywork.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Top 3 Priorities\n\n1. **Shape the Innovation Sprint narrative** for Byron — conversational, not formal. Frame it as \"what's next after the thesis\" over dinner/drinks\n2. **Crema/Certs conversation** with Byron — on your Things list, knock it out during downtime\n3. **Observe and learn** at Microsoft meetings — feed insights into EA Practice pitch (G4)\n\n---\n\n## ⚡ Quick Win\n\n**Text Nav about Puru promotion** — open thread from last week. 2 minutes while waiting between sessions.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Watch Out\n\n**Burnout from yesterday.** Bad travel day + early grind = low reserves. Don't try to do too much. Pick 1-2 meaningful conversations with Byron and call it a win.\n\n---\n\n**Spark:** You wrote in yesterday's capture: \"Super tired.\" That's real. Emergence isn't about grinding harder — it's about showing up at the right moments. Today has a few of those. Be present for them.",
