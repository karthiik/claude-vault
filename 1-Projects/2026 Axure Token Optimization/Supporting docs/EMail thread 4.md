Olaoluwa - I sent you this earlier today, so sorry for the duplicate info - but sending here for visibility. We're currently waiting on the AOAI Triage/PG team to provide an update on two escalations that are connected to this Case. The triage team reached out late this afternoon requesting the support ticket associated as it's not properly linked to the AOAI Resource/Subscription in the request. Can you kindly route to the AOAI capacity triage team for new region/model deployments so that a quota ID can be generated? The UAT escalation details are below:

Required region/model is unavailable -- this is not a Quota increase request, new region/model quota needed for deployment
---------
Deployment type: DataZoneStandard | Region: North Europe | Model: gpt-4.1 | Quota: 2M TPM (MCA-E Default Tier) ----- UAT 660461 & UAT 662715
Deployment type: DataZoneStandard | Region: North Europe | Model: gpt-5 | Quota: 3M TPM (MCA-E Default Tier) ----- UAT 662819
Subscription ID: 40758a60-73cd-4012-b5fb-53200054ff17
---------
Business Justification: Lockton requires activation of Azure OpenAI gpt-4.1 and gpt-5 in North Europe to meet EU data residency/compliance mandates enforced by security/regulatory teams. Current regions/deployment types do not satisfy GDPR and regional policy requirements. This is already significantly impacting customer roadmaps and delaying production workloads. Current options represent indefinite blocker for AOAI adoption for customer not only in regulated environments but potentially also at scale; Customer has indicated no alternative region or deployment is viable to their use case per compliance and security governance policies.
---------
Quota Request submitted in Azure Portal per UAT Escalation guidelines (via Support Partner SHI) > Service Request - T20251119.0493 / Case ID - 2510070040011806 / TrackingID - 2511250040010418

Hello Larry,



I hope you’re doing well. Please accept my apologies for the earlier mix-up. I wasn’t aware of your initial arrangement with Monica and the other members of the Azure OpenAI team.



My previous response was based on the service request opened for a quota increase, kindly accept my apologies for the confusion.


Could you kindly share your availability for a quick call? This will help us better understand the full scope of your request and ensure we’re aligned moving forward.



I truly appreciate your attention and continued support on this matter.

You don't often get email from llane@lockton.com. Learn why this is important

Olaoluwa,


@Monica Choto already got the wheels in motion if this in regards to provisioning open AI Models in the North Europe Region?


Maybe this is just an automated response but I would like to get our communication tightened up the best we can and confused to why you are sending a quota request form when @Ramadoss, Karthik and I have already had a call with the Monica and other members of the Azure Open AI team. If this is not correct please provide an SOP we can follow that includes scenarios when the model infrastructure is not provisioned for Data Zone Standard in specific regions. Monica let us know that it usually takes 2 weeks once approved but would work towards expediting this.


Cc: @Reimer, Bret


Thank you,
Larry
