|Hi,<br><br>I am reaching out to invite you to join our Executive PACE Steering Committee.<br><br>What is PACE - People and Culture Excellence programme ?<br><br>At its heart, PACE is about equipping all of us with the tools, insights and support we need to keep Lockton a place where our people thrive - today and into the future. It is a key enabler of our People Strategy and will help us scale, simplify and deliver an outstanding experience for Associates across the globe.<br><br>Over the past few months, we’ve made strong progress. We’ve just completed our _Phase Zero_ discovery work with the global Talent Acquisition team, and planning is already underway for _Phase One_. Our goal is to deploy new platforms and capabilities across the business during FY27, with further enhancements continuing through FY30.<br><br>Why PACE?<br><br>Right now, our systems and processes vary significantly across Series and Regions. This can make simple things harder than they need to be for Associates and for us, and it keeps us from delivering consistent, efficient, and people-focused support.<br><br>PACE will change this by:|

|   |

|- Driving **consistency** across platforms and processes<br>- Reducing administrative burden so we can focus more on **strategic consultation and partnership**<br>- Enabling **real-time insights** to support better decision-making<br>- Enhancing the **candidate** and **Associate experience globally**|

How you can support PACE

We would be delighted if you could join our **Executive PACE Steering Committee**, this is a critical governance forum to guide the successful implementation of our people transformation strategy and shape the future of our organization. Your functional leadership perspective and strategic insight are essential to ensure alignment across business priorities and to drive impactful outcomes. As a member, I would ask for your active engagement in providing directional input, making strategic decisions, and championing change.  Starting in January 2026 we will be looking to run the Steering Committee every two months, calendar invites to follow.

In the meantime, I have attached an update summarising the programme and have also included our quarterly communication “Pace on a Page”, along with the Accelerated PACE plan.  if you have any questions regarding the PACE programme or the Steering Committee please reach out to Sarah McCann or myself.

Many thanks,

Darren
