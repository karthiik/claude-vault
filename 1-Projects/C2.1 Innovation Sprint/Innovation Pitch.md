# Innovation Pitch: Byron Clymer
**Target Audience:** Byron Clymer, Global CIO
**Purpose:** Secure sponsorship for IT-led AI innovation sprint, partnering with Shared Services
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Storyline Summary

> **The Arc:** We've proven IT can innovate (hackathon). Microsoft showed us the playbook (Kaizen + AI, business sponsorship). Now we partner with Shared Services to deliver quick, measurable wins that Tim and Nick can champion — then scale globally once credibility is built.

---

## Slide 1: The Moment We're In

**Title:** *We Have Momentum. Now We Need a System.*

**Narrative:**
- The GAS Summit and Hackathon proved something important: **our people want to innovate**
- We generated energy, ideas, and enthusiasm
- But hackathon energy fades without a system to sustain it
- **The risk:** We lose the moment. Ideas die in inboxes. People disengage.
- **The opportunity:** Channel this energy into a repeatable engine that delivers results

**Visual:** Energy wave rising (hackathon) → question mark (what's next?) → sustained rhythm (innovation system)

## Slide 2: Microsoft Showed Us the Playbook

**Title:** *What We Learned in Seattle: The Recipe That Works*

**Narrative:**
- Microsoft didn't just give us inspiration — they gave us a **proven framework**
- Kathleen Hogan (EVP, Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer) shared the recipe:

| Microsoft's Innovation Recipe | What It Means for Lockton |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Kaizen First, AI Second** | Find the waste in processes → then layer AI on top |
| **Business Leader Sponsorship** | "Unless a business leader is sponsoring it, we don't work on it" |
| **Shared Services Council** | Cross-functional group to surface and prioritize opportunities |
| **Measure the Impact** | Hard metrics, not just stories |

**Key Insight:**
> "When you do Kaizen, you'll find a lot of waste. Then you layer in AI."

This isn't innovation theater — it's disciplined improvement with modern tools.

## Slide 3: Byron's Strategic Priorities Demand This

**Title:** *This Aligns with Where You're Steering the Ship*

**Narrative:**
Connect directly to what Byron said at the MS briefing:

| Byron's Priority | How Innovation Sprints Deliver |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Scale without doing everything differently** | Repeatable framework, not one-off projects |
| **Remove friction, cost-constrained** | Kaizen finds waste; AI automates the pain points |
| **Data quality as table stakes** | Sprint focus on data governance and clean pipelines |
| **Get data out for analytics** | Build the integration layer that enables reporting |
| **Hard metrics behind ROI** | Every sprint has measurable success criteria |

**The Connection:**
Your vision: *"IT's job is to remove friction — but cost-constrained."*
This framework delivers exactly that: **systematic friction removal, measured results**.

## Slide 4: The Approach — People Before Agents

**Title:** *Workforce Enablement Unlocks Scale*

**Narrative:**
AI won't transform insurance through pilots alone. The experiments prove what works — but transformation requires enabling **every person** to benefit.

**The Progression:**
```
Level 1: Summarize → emails, documents, meetings
Level 2: Automate → action items, routine tasks
Level 3: Create → presentations, reports, drafts
Level 4: Trust → agentic workflows with human oversight
```

**Why This Matters:**
- AI is "jagged" — brilliant at some things, fails at basics
- You can't trust it blindly; you need experience to know the edges
- **When the workforce is enabled, AI scales naturally**
- Every person becomes AI-augmented, not just the pilot teams

**Microsoft validated this:** They trained the trainer, ran mentor office hours, brought people along intentionally.

## Slide 5: Why Shared Services First

**Title:** *Start Where Wins Are Visible and Cross-Functional*

**Narrative:**
We need to build credibility before going global. Shared Services is the right starting point:

| Why Shared Services? | |
|---------------------|---|
| **High volume, repeatable processes** | Ideal for Kaizen + AI |
| **Cross-functional visibility** | Tim and Nick see impact across all business units |
| **Measurable outcomes** | Cycle time, error rates, cost per transaction |
| **Internal customers** | Lower risk than client-facing pilots |
| **Quick wins compound** | Each improvement builds the case for scale |

**Microsoft's Insight:**
> "Shared services should form a council to share ideas on what could be done across all areas."

We form that council. IT provides the enablement. Business provides the sponsorship.

## Slide 6: The Sprint Model

**Title:** *From Hackathon Energy to Repeatable Rhythm*

**Narrative:**
Not random innovation — **disciplined sprints** with clear governance:

| Element | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| **Sprint Duration** | 4 weeks (enough to deliver, short enough to course-correct) |
| **Business Sponsor** | Every sprint has a Shared Services leader attached |
| **Success Criteria** | Defined upfront — pass/fail is clear |
| **Kaizen Phase** | Week 1: Map the process, identify waste |
| **Build Phase** | Weeks 2-3: AI-enabled solution |
| **Validate Phase** | Week 4: Measure, document, decide (scale/kill/iterate) |

**What IT Provides:**
- Infrastructure for secure AI deployment
- Data governance and integration layer
- Measurement and tracing frameworks
- Sprint facilitation and technical enablement

**What Business Provides:**
- Process ownership and domain expertise
- Sponsorship and prioritization
- Change management for their teams
- Success metrics and adoption

## Slide 7: What Tim and Nick Will See in Q2

**Title:** *Tangible Wins by Mid-Year*

**Narrative:**
This isn't a roadmap that disappears into 2027. Here's what success looks like by Q2 2026:

| Win | Metric | Visibility |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| **3 completed sprints** | End-to-end delivery | Demonstrated capability |
| **Measurable efficiency gains** | Hours saved, error reduction, cycle time | Hard ROI Tim/Nick can report |
| **Enabled workforce cohort** | Shared Services team AI-fluent | Adoption, not just deployment |
| **Documented playbook** | Repeatable for next wave | Scalability proof |
| **Business-led sponsorship** | Not IT pushing — business pulling | Sustainable model |

**The Story for Tim/Nick:**
> "IT partnered with us to deliver X hours saved, Y% error reduction, and a trained team ready to identify the next opportunity. We want to expand this."

That's the story they tell. That's credibility built.

## Slide 8: The Scale Path — After We Prove It

**Title:** *Shared Services → Digital → Global*

**Narrative:**
We're not asking to boil the ocean. We're asking to **earn the right** to scale:

```
Q1-Q2 2026: Shared Services (Build Credibility)
    ↓
Q3 2026: Digital (Byron champions to peer CIOs)
    ↓
Q4 2026+: Global expansion via regional champions
```

**Phase 1: Shared Services (Now)**
- Partner with Tim/Nick's teams
- Deliver 3-5 measurable wins
- Build the playbook and train the trainers

**Phase 2: Digital (Fast Follow)**
- Digital teams see Shared Services wins
- Byron champions the model to Digital leadership
- Expand to client-facing process improvements

**Phase 3: Global (Earned Scale)**
- Regional CIOs adopt the proven playbook
- Local champions trained and enabled
- Innovation rhythm becomes Lockton standard

**Why This Works:**
- We don't oversell before we've proven
- Each phase builds on demonstrated success
- Global rollout has local ownership (your "hire local CEO" model)

## Slide 9: Addressing the Hard Questions

**Title:** *What We Know You're Thinking*

**Narrative:**
Based on your concerns from Seattle, here's how we address them:

| Concern | Our Answer |
|---------|-----------|
| **"Insurance expects fully baked, not MVPs"** | Sprints deliver complete solutions with human-in-the-loop — not half-built demos |
| **"How do we get hard metrics behind ROI?"** | Success criteria defined before sprint starts; measured ruthlessly |
| **"Change management is the hard part"** | HR business partner involved; process owner leads adoption; IT enables |
| **"We're skittish on global comms"** | We don't communicate globally until we have wins to show; local first |
| **"Multiple cultures, need to be specific"** | Shared Services is internal; we learn the model before going external |

**Microsoft's Principle:**
> "Bad news is better than uncertainty. Share intent."

We're sharing intent: IT wants to partner with Shared Services to build a proven model. No promises we haven't earned. Credibility first.

## Slide 10: The Ask

**Title:** *What We Need from You*

**Narrative:**
This isn't a budget ask. It's a sponsorship ask.

| Ask | Why It Matters |
|-----|---------------|
| **1. Your sponsorship** | "Unless a business leader is sponsoring it, we don't work on it" — we need you as the IT champion |
| **2. Introduction to Tim/Nick** | Position this as IT partnering with Shared Services — not IT pushing a project |
| **3. Cover for experimentation** | Some sprints will fail. We need air cover to learn fast and pivot |
| **4. Quarterly visibility** | Brief you on progress; adjust course as needed |

**What You Get:**
- A framework that scales without doing everything differently
- Hard metrics to demonstrate IT value
- Workforce enablement that compounds over time
- A story to tell at the next Executive Briefing

## Slide 11: Why This, Why Now

**Title:** *The Window Is Open*

**Narrative:**
Three forces are converging:

| Force | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| **Hackathon momentum** | People are energized *now* — energy fades fast |
| **Microsoft playbook** | Fresh insights from Seattle; validated approach |
| **Lockton growth targets** | $4B → $7.1B requires efficiency, not just headcount |

**The Choice:**
- **Option A:** Let momentum fade. Next hackathon in 2027. Ideas die.
- **Option B:** Channel the energy into a system. Build credibility. Scale from strength.

**One-Liner:**
> "AI in insurance isn't a technology project — it's a workforce transformation. Our digital investments create the foundation; now we scale by enabling every person to use it."
