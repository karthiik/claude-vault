2026 Lockton Global Architecture Summit Recap

60+ people. 7 countries. 3 days in Kansas City. Our 3rd Global Architecture Summit just wrapped (Jan 12-14, 2026).

Here's what happened.

**Day 1: Preparation - The Messy Middle**

I opened the summit with a word: Preparation.

AI is everywhere right now. Every vendor pitch, every conference keynote, every board meeting. And the pressure to move fast is real. But I wanted to start the summit by talking about something less exciting: the work underneath.

Here's what I mean by the "Messy Middle": it's the infrastructure layer between brilliant AI ideas and production-ready solutions. Cloud migration still in progress. DevSecOps pipelines that need hardening. Data governance that's inconsistent across regions. These aren't failures. They are the real areas of work IT teams across the globe have in our hands.

The teams building AI innovations are doing exactly what we need them to do. They're proving what's possible, finding the edges, and showing us where the foundation cracks under pressure. That's valuable insight.

Our job in IT is to strengthen that foundation fast enough to keep up with them.

It's a partnership. Innovation teams push us to modernize faster. Our modernization helps them ship faster. Neither side wins alone. We win, together!

Byron Clymer followed with a keynote that gave our technical audience something they don't always get: a deep look at how Lockton business works across the globe. He walked us through the insurance brokerage business from parametric insurance to emerging innovations happening across the industry. For technologists who spend their days in code and infrastructure, understanding the brokerage model we're building for matters.

It gave every technical session that followed a business foundation and context to build on.

The full Day 1 lineup:

• **Summit Opening & Welcome** by Karthik Ramadoss - Introduced the "Messy Middle" theme, what we do about it in light of AI and the word of the summit: Preparation
• **Opening Keynote** by Byron Clymer - Walked us through the insurance brokerage business and how Lockton makes money
• **Global Enterprise Architecture Panel** by David George, James Solko, Karthik Ramadoss, Shanna Sommers - Tackled the big questions facing architecture teams across regions
• **TechTalk: Risk Management & Compliance** by Elizabeth Thomas, David Collins - How we're thinking about security and compliance in an AI-first world
• **Podcast: GitReal - No Merge Conflict, Just Real Talk** by Megan Matile & GitReal Team - Live recording covering real engineering culture topics
• **Breakout: Security Track** by Raoul Hira - Hands-on security practices with Vibe Coding and threat awareness
• **Breakout: Mulesoft Technical Expert** by Kumar Vuddaraju & Bill Hamilton - API integration patterns and Mulesoft best practices
• **Breakout: Databricks - Productionalizing AI** by Daniel Tomes, Field CTO - Moving AI from experiments to production workloads
• **Day 1 Closing Remarks** by James Solko - Recap and setup for Day 2

We ran the breakouts Olympics-style: three teams (Canada, Norway, USA) rotating through all three tracks. Kept the energy competitive.

Dinner was at Boulevard Brewing. Shuffleboard, conversations, and a lot of fun happened. Ideas kept flowing and new work relationships were forming.

**Day 2: Getting Specific - Hard Questions**

The full Day 2 lineup:

• **Day 2 Welcome** by Karthik Ramadoss
• **Keynote: AI Security** by Felix Simmons - Real attack vectors and security considerations as AI scales across the enterprise
• **Architecture of Olympics** by Jill Hodge - Connected Olympic training principles to how we approach architecture discipline
• **TechTalk: Affinity and Beyond - Mission 0001** by Julie Morris - shared real world example of how Affinity is innovating
• **TechTalk: M365 PowerPlatform** by Travis Chambers - What's actually possible with Power Platform today. The real talk.
• **Breakout: AI Agents Track** by Larry Lane, Shane Strong - Building and deploying autonomous AI agents
• **Breakout: Perficient - Dynamic Agent Frameworks** by Nico Frantzen - Patterns for flexible, adaptable agent architectures and smart AI dashboards
• **Breakout: Data & Fabric Track** by Rajesh Paul, James Solko - Data architecture foundations that enable AI at scale
• **Day 2 Closing Remarks** by Karthik Ramadoss - Wrapped up and setup for Hackathon Day

Evening: KC BBQ at Joe's. Trivia competition. Someone's team name was "Hallucinating LLMs" which felt appropriate.

**Day 3: Hackathon**

*23 teams. Two regions. One day to build something real.*

Teams from the US competed in-person at Lockton's Kansas City headquarters while teams from India joined virtually from 2 locations. The challenges spanned three themes: making associates' daily work easier, automating business processes that slow people down, and improving how IT operates behind the scenes. 

Each team had to build a working prototype, then 10 minutes to present: problem, solution, live demo, Q&A.

What stood out wasn't just the technical quality. It was the energy. People who spend most of their year heads-down on project work came in with ideas they'd been sitting on for months. Some for years. The hackathon gave them a place to *finally build it.*

That's the part we're taking with us. There's bottled-up innovation energy across IT. 

We saw it in the room. We heard it at dinner. 

The question now is: *how do we channel that into something routine?* 

Not a once-a-year event, but making this culture of innovation a part of how we work. A culture where people can identify a problem, pitch a solution, and build it without blocked by red tape. 

We're going to figure that out. Some of the solutions from Day 3 are already in conversations about production. 

That's the goal: ***meaningful outcomes for the people around us at Lockton.***

**Our Focus for 2026**

• Retire technical debt faster
• Finish cloud migration where it's progress
• Double down on DevSecOps
• Get hands-on with AI tools (what I'm calling "AI Gym" time)

**The Numbers**

2024 (Atlanta): 30 attendees
2025 (Dallas): 55 attendees
2026 (Kansas City): 60+ attendees

**What's Next**

Quarterly virtual summits. 
Monthly AC4E lunch-and-learns. 

Thanks to everyone who showed up, presented, asked hard questions, and stayed late arguing about architecture and brews and best BBQ.

## AI Slop Corrections Made

| Original | Revised | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| "Deep dive" | "Walked us through" | Tier 1 AI slop |
| "set the stage" | "gave...a foundation to build on" | Puffery phrase |
| "invaluable context" | "matters" | Generic AI phrasing |
| "The momentum is real." | Cut | AI enthusiasm; numbers speak for themselves |
| "Deep Tracks" in Day 2 header | "Hard Questions" | "Deep" is AI slop adjacent |
| "&" symbol | "and" | Cleaner for LinkedIn |
| Emojis in section headers | Removed | Per AI slop guide, limit emojis |
