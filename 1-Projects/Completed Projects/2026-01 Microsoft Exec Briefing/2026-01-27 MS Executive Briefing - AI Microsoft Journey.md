Byron:
- massive human capital in organization 
- multiple cultures - how do you articulate message of transformation across the globe 
- we are skittish on global comms 
	- we get hit with when we are going to have it? 
	- organization - has a culture change need 
	- insurance world isnt receptive to MVPs and Pilots - expect fully baked 
	- have to be very specific about what we build and roll out
- How are getting to hard metrics behind ROI
	- The business itself 
- How did you do the change management?
	- partnering with the teams using it 
	- once you redesign the process with business leader
	- based on whats changing, involve HR business partner 
	- measure the impact of the change 
		- solution to the kaizen mapping with the AI experts
	- How do you communicate intent?

Notes
- Humans are in controi

	- ==share intent== 
	- ==yes some jobs are going away - but we are going to help future proof it== 
- 
Innovation Recipe

- ==**When do Kaizen - you'll find a lot of waste**==
