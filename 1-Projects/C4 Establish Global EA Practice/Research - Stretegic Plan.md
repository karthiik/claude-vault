# Strategic Plan: Modernizing Enterprise Architecture for Business Value

## 1.0 The Imperative for Change: Evolving Beyond Traditional Architecture

Enterprise Architecture (EA) is at a critical inflection point, not just within our organization, but across the industry. After years of tension, market leaders are now recognizing that architecture and agile must coexist, leading to a widespread movement of "rehabilitating and restoring" EA practices to drive value in modern digital business. While EA remains an essential capability for operating at scale, traditional, rigid practices are misaligned with the speed and adaptability required today. To restore our strategic value and become a true partner in driving business outcomes, we must fundamentally evolve our approach, culture, and operational model.

The impetus for our transformation is the clear and present danger of clinging to legacy practices that have marginalized EA teams. These outdated approaches have created significant friction and alienated us from the very delivery teams we exist to support. Key challenges include:

- A restrictive **Waterfall orientation**, where architecture reviews appear as a required step between planning and building, causing entire projects to be delayed when concerns are raised.
- An "ivory tower" reputation, where developers perceive architects as prioritizing abstract ideals of architectural purity over the practical delivery of working code.
- Acting as an **Obstruction of delivery**, creating unacceptable delays and friction. At one large retailer, database administrators (DBAs) wouldn’t create or alter schemas without signoff from a data architect, a requirement that proved so cumbersome the firm was forced to scrap it.
- An antipattern of being the **sole design authority**, following a dysfunctional "architects design and coders code" model that stifles engineering autonomy and collaboration.
- Functioning as an **innovation blocker**. At Target, the EA approval process for new technologies introduced so much delay and friction that the company’s IT leaders replaced it with a collaborative approach, moving from governance to guidance.

When EA fails to provide cohesive guidance, architectural fragmentation becomes inevitable. This creates a cascade of negative business consequences that undermine our agility, efficiency, and competitive edge.

- **Inconsistent Technology Choices:** Without a shared vision and collaborative guidance, technology sprawl threatens interoperability and jeopardizes the seamless exchange of information. As Andrew Christianto, Chief Platform Officer at Schneider Electric, notes, _"When you don’t have a community, when you don’t share the same vision between those architects ... it’s a mess on how you translate it into the technology choice."_
- **Duplicated Effort and Capabilities:** Autonomous teams operating in silos frequently reinvent the wheel, leading to redundant work, wasted time, and unnecessary costs. Samrat Mitra of Shell highlights this inefficiency: _"You can’t have Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple email ... that’s a waste of money. We need to be more disciplined down the line to make sure we reuse the same technical and software engineering capability."_
- **Siloed Knowledge:** When expertise is guarded in isolated pockets, it becomes a significant barrier to enterprise success. This prevents the organization from leveraging its collective intelligence and makes governance exceptionally difficult.
- **Stalled Innovation:** Without shared forums for cross-pollination, great ideas remain trapped within individual teams. As Gunther Bonnard, Head of Architecture at Philip Morris International, explains, _"Before the community of practice, adoption required significant effort, and inconsistent standards led to fragmented practices and slowed innovation."_

Recognizing these challenges is the first step toward building a modern architecture practice designed for the future.

## 2.0 Our Vision: An Outcome-Driven Enterprise Architecture Practice

Our vision is to transform the Enterprise Architecture practice from a technology-centric gatekeeper into a strategic, business-focused partner that accelerates value delivery. We will move away from command-and-control mandates and toward a federated model built on influence, collaboration, and measurable results. To guide this transformation, we will adopt Forrester's Outcome-Driven Architecture Model, a framework that aligns all architectural activities directly with tangible business outcomes.

The culture and values of our modernized EA team will be defined by a set of foundational priorities that govern how we operate, engage, and deliver value.

- **Valuable:** We will drive specific, measurable business outcomes. Our focus will be on the "expensive-to-change decisions" that directly manage risk, optimize cost, or enable revenue.
- **Agile:** We will embody and support iterative, experimental, and incremental approaches, ensuring architecture is a collaborative partner within the agile development lifecycle, not an external checkpoint.
- **Innovative:** We will act as the department of "why not?", keeping up with technical advances while also accepting that most innovation emerges from frontline delivery teams. We will support these grassroots efforts and avoid a knee-jerk "department of no" response.
- **Influential:** We will manage by influence and federated partnership, not by mandate. Our goal is to encourage enterprise alignment and discourage short-sighted decisions through consultation and consensus.
- **Accountable:** We will have clear, measured accountability tied to business impact. Our success will be tracked through metrics that reflect our contribution to organizational goals.
- **Collaborative:** We will work in partnership across business and technology domains. Facilitation and consensus-building are the core skills of the modern architect.

Our work will be directly aligned with and measured against four distinct business outcomes:

1. **Risk Management:** We will serve as a critical control for IT risks, including security breaches, privacy concerns, system outages, and third-party exposures, ensuring the resilience and integrity of our technology landscape.
2. **Cost Efficiency:** We will minimize consumed resources by driving the consolidation and streamlining of our technology and application portfolios, removing redundancy and obsolescence to optimize IT spend.
3. **Customer & Employee Experience (CX/EX):** We will contribute directly to superior experiences by governing the critical data and processes that underpin customer and employee journeys, ensuring consistency and quality.
4. **Revenue & Mission Growth:** We will reduce the cost of delay by enabling rapid delivery on standard platforms and serve as trusted advisors on business innovations, helping to discover new customer and market opportunities.

We must reject the notion that the best architecture simply emerges without guidance. As Pierre Pureur, VP and Enterprise Chief Architect at Travelers, cautions:

"Yes, some architecture will emerge, but it may be ugly. The cost of refactoring can exceed the cost of building in the first place."

Achieving this vision requires a deliberate and strategic investment in building the operational capabilities that will bring it to life.

## 3.0 Building Our Core Capabilities

To realize our vision of an outcome-driven practice, we must intentionally develop a set of core architecture capabilities. These capabilities are the operational components that define who we are, what we do, what we deliver, and how we engage with the organization. They are the engine that will power our transformation and enable us to provide clear, consistent value.

Our capabilities are structured around four distinct pillars:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Capability Pillar|Strategic Definition|
|**People**|Define architect roles (e.g., business, data, solution), establish clear career paths, and facilitate continuous training to attract and retain top talent.|
|**Practices**|Formalize what architects do beyond domain specifics, including acting as internal consultants, investment advisors, and research analysts to guide strategic decisions.|
|**Artifacts**|Standardize what architects deliver (e.g., principles, models, patterns, technology standards) to ensure they add specific value to the digital systems delivery process.|
|**Offerings**|Define how the organization interacts with architecture through clearly defined touchpoints, services, and processes, making our capabilities relevant and accessible.|

These capabilities will not be developed in a vacuum. They will be built and operationalized through two primary strategic initiatives: fostering a collaborative, cross-functional community and implementing a comprehensive talent development program for our architects.

## 4.0 Strategic Initiative 1: Launching an Open Architecture Community

The central mechanism for breaking down silos and embedding our new collaborative mindset is the creation of an **Open Architecture Community**. Unlike a traditional, focused community composed only of architects, this open forum will be inherently cross-functional, actively including key business and IT stakeholders. This approach will drive stronger alignment, promote a shared sense of purpose, and ensure that our architectural decisions are grounded in the real-world needs of the business.

By establishing this community, we will directly address the fragmentation challenges that have stalled progress and unlock significant strategic benefits:

- **Share knowledge and best practices** to unlock the value of experience across technology and business domains.
- **Define and develop architectural standards collaboratively**, allowing them to emerge from the ground up to ensure consensus and adoption.
- **Promote innovation through the cross-pollination of ideas** between diverse perspectives, creating synergies that would not otherwise exist.
- **Support decentralized, context-aware decision-making**, empowering architects closest to the execution while ensuring alignment through dialogue.
- **Mentor junior architects and build a robust talent pipeline** by offering a welcoming environment that accelerates career growth and expertise.

We will follow a proven 7-step roadmap to build and sustain a thriving community:

1. **Define the purpose** of the community in a formal charter that articulates its mission to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and break down silos.
2. **Schedule a regular meeting series** to establish a consistent rhythm, including a "weekly architecture marketplace" to detail changes, "biweekly architecture afternoons" for technical news, and an "architecture workshop zone" to resolve conflicts and make decisions.
3. **Recruit members from across functions**, actively engaging both IT and business stakeholders to ensure discussions are rich with diverse perspectives.
4. **Create a rotating core team** of 3-5 people to drive engagement and maintain momentum. We will select people who demonstrate **energy, initiative, curiosity, and leadership** and rotate this team annually to bring in fresh perspectives.
5. **Hold periodic online events**, such as webinars and roundtables, to explore emerging technologies and business topics, reaching a broader audience flexibly.
6. **Measure community value** through meaningful qualitative feedback from members to surface unmet needs and identify opportunities for improvement.
7. **Hold an annual in-person event** to celebrate achievements, showcase how architecture drives business outcomes, and reinforce the strategic value of the community.

The success of this community is inextricably linked to the skills and capabilities of its members, which makes our commitment to architect development more critical than ever.

## 5.0 Strategic Initiative 2: A Holistic Approach to Architect Development

A high-performing Enterprise Architecture practice requires high-performing architects. The rise of the AI-driven enterprise boosts the strategic importance and reshapes the responsibilities of architects, making this comprehensive training initiative a strategic lifeline, not just a professional development program. This initiative will establish a holistic development strategy to ensure our team has the sophisticated blend of technical mastery, business acumen, and interpersonal influence required to lead our transformation.

Our strategy is built on three interconnected dimensions that create a holistic approach to architect development:

- **Technical Training:** Foundational skills required for excellence.
    - Mastery of our **company-specific framework** and reusable components to ensure every architect understands our unique standards, patterns, and infrastructure.
    - Expertise in **modern methodologies**, including Agile, cloud, APIs, and Generative AI, to ensure our guidance is relevant and forward-looking.
    - Knowledge of **industry-standard frameworks** (e.g., TOGAF) to provide a common architectural language and an external perspective on best practices.
- **Behavioral Training:** The soft skills that build influence and trust.
    - **Collaboration and Mediation:** We will provide training in facilitation and conflict resolution to emphasize the architect's role as _"the glue that brings the business side, the data side, and the IT side together,"_ as described by NTT Group.
    - **Leadership and Communication:** We will cultivate skills in meeting facilitation, storytelling, public speaking, and active writing to enable architects to articulate complex ideas clearly and persuasively.
    - **Business Acumen:** We will ensure architects understand our company culture, its customers, and the financial implications of their decisions. We will encourage them to operate by the imperative: _"Don’t just stay in your lane; get out and see what’s happening around you."_
- **Career Development:** Pathways for growth and retention.
    - **Structured Mentoring:** We will implement what is arguably the most effective path for architects: formal mentoring programs lasting at least nine months. This will facilitate the transfer of invaluable tacit knowledge and shorten the learning curve for developing practitioners.
    - **Knowledge Sharing:** We will encourage active participation in the Architecture Community, recognizing it as a powerful catalyst for visibility, leadership development, and career growth.
    - **HR Alignment:** We will partner with HR to create a clear competency matrix that links training, competence, and career advancement, providing architects with a transparent path for progression.

To ensure these strategic initiatives deliver on their promise, we will hold ourselves accountable by establishing clear and transparent metrics for success.

## 6.0 Measuring Our Success

Our commitment to becoming an outcome-driven practice demands accountability. As the industry increasingly recognizes the value of modern EA, with 75% of professionals stating their technology organization clearly understands architecture’s value proposition, we will adopt rigorous metrics to ensure we are not just participating in this trend, but leading it. The success of this plan will be measured by its tangible impact on business outcomes and organizational health.

### Key Performance Indicators for a Modern EA Practice

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Metric Category|Specific KPIs|
|**Business Impact**|- Reduction in quantified technical debt.<br>- Acceleration of project/product development time-to-market.<br>- Increased reuse of architectural patterns and components.|
|**Value & Perception**|- Improvement in Developer Experience (DX) scores related to architectural guidance.<br>- Positive trends in independently facilitated perception audits.|
|**Team & Talent**|- Employee Net Promoter Score℠ (eNPS) for the architecture team.<br>- Engagement levels and qualitative feedback from the Architecture Community.|

These metrics will be reviewed quarterly by leadership to ensure our practice remains aligned with its strategic goals and is delivering demonstrable value to the enterprise.

This plan marks a deliberate shift for Enterprise Architecture—from a siloed, process-oriented function to a collaborative, outcome-driven strategic partner. Championing this evolution is not just a matter of support; it is a direct investment in the future agility, innovation, and competitive advantage of our enterprise.
