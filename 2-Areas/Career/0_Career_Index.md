## Vision

**North Star (2031):** Portfolio career — technology executive + thought leader

### The Picture

- **Life:** Work-life balance as priority. Son in college. Time for what matters.
- **Pursuits:** Global travel with partner. Motorcycling trips.
- **Role:** Technology leader (CTO-level) at large organization, <$10B revenue
- **Impact:**
  1. Help business leaders understand and apply technology effectively
  2. Help tech professionals grow their careers
- **Reach:** Publishing and speaking engagements — share lessons learned for broader impact

### Why This Works

The operating role provides leverage and credibility. The teaching/publishing extends impact beyond company walls. Both feed each other.

## 2026 Theme

> **"The year I become visible outside Lockton."**

*One theme to guide decisions. Everything else is secondary.*

### Success Criteria (Dec 2026)

- [ ] 1+ external speaking engagement (conference, podcast, or panel) #area/career #p1
- [ ] 2+ published articles beyond LinkedIn #area/career #p2
- [ ] Innovation thesis articulated and tested with external audiences #area/career #p2
- [ ] At least 1 external sponsor/advocate relationship developed #area/career #p2

### Why This Theme?

Internal credibility is established (GAS Summit, AI expert, GCC expansion). The gap to CTO and thought leadership is **external visibility**. 2026 is the year to close that gap.
