## Vision

**North Star (2031):** Portfolio career — technology executive + thought leader

### The Picture

- **Life:** Work-life balance as priority. Son in college. Time for what matters.
- **Pursuits:** Global travel with partner. Motorcycling trips.
- **Role:** Technology leader (CTO-level) at large organization, <$10B revenue
- **Impact:**
  1. Help business leaders understand and apply technology effectively
  2. Help tech professionals grow their careers
- **Reach:** Publishing and speaking engagements — share lessons learned for broader impact

### Why This Works

The operating role provides leverage and credibility. The teaching/publishing extends impact beyond company walls. Both feed each other.
