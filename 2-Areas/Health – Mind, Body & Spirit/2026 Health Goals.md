## The Pattern to Break

> *"You've let health slip before — eating, activity, strength. Name it, remember it, don't repeat it this year."*

**Specific slips to avoid:**
- Snacking (especially crunchy/salty)
- Uber Eats after travel (empty fridge trap)
- Weight training dropping off
- Consuming instead of creating

**The fix:** Meal prep, pre-stock fridge before travel, protect weight training time, mornings for creation.
