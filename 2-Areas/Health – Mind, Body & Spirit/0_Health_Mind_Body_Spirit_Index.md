# Health – Mind, Body & Spirit

> Transforming my body to be lean and energized, sharpening focus and clarity, grounding in mindfulness over materialism

---

## Vision

### Body — AT Ready by 50

**The Goal:** Hike 100 miles of the Appalachian Trail before turning 50 (Jan 2028)

**What this requires:**
- Endurance for multi-day hiking with pack weight
- Leg and core strength
- Reduced body weight (lean, not heavy)
- Consistent training over 2 years

**Current training:** Rucking with 20 lb — need to progressively increase weight.

### Mind — Creation Over Consumption

**The Shift:**
- Less: Distractions, YouTube, TV
- More: Books, deep work, focused creation

**The Ratio:** Move from 5% creation / 95% consumption → net positive creation.

**Why this matters:** Focused attention is the lever that achieves goals across all areas. Distraction is the enemy.

### Spirit — Contentment Regardless of Circumstance

**The State:** Happy with more, happy with less.

Non-attachment to material things. Grounded in what matters: health, relationships, purpose — not possessions.

---

## Current State

| Dimension | Working | Gap |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| **Body** | Rucking 2-3x/week when not traveling | Snacking, non-ruck activity, weight training (equipment exists, habit doesn't) |
| **Mind** | — | 95% consumption / 5% creation; YouTube & TV dominant |
| **Spirit** | Morning journaling, reading at bed & wake | No evening reflection yet |

### The Pattern to Break

> *"You've let health slip before — eating, activity, strength. Name it, remember it, don't repeat it this year."*
> — Principles to Carry Forward

The specific slips:
- **Eating:** Snacking, post-travel Uber Eats habit
- **Activity:** Weight training drops off
- **Strength:** Equipment (Tonal, Peloton) unused

---

## 2026 Focus

| Dimension | Focus | Target |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Body** | Eat less salty/restaurant food | Meal prep habit, pre-stock before travel |
| **Mind** | Time blocks for creation vs. consumption | Morning + weekend creation blocks |
| **Spirit** | Add evening ritual | AI-assisted quick reflection in Obsidian |

---

## Habits & Routines

### Body

| Cadence | Activity | Equipment |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **2-3x/week** | Rucking (progressively increase weight) | Ruck pack |
| **2-3x/week** | Weight training | Tonal, Peloton |
| **Weekly** | Meal prep | — |
| **Before travel return** | Stock fridge with healthy food | — |

**Eating Principles:**
- Reduce crunchy snacks
- Reduce salty/restaurant food
- Meal prep is the key
- Post-travel trap: Empty fridge → Uber Eats. **Solution:** Pre-stock before returning.

### Mind

| Cadence | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| **Mornings** | Creation time block (before consumption) |
| **Weekends** | Extended creation time |
| **Evenings** | Consumption allowed (but limited) |

**The Rule:** Create before you consume. Mornings are for building, not scrolling.

### Spirit

| Cadence | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| **Morning** | Journaling — set intentions |
| **Evening** | Quick reflection — AI-assisted review |
| **Bed/Wake** | Reading (books, not screens) |

### Evening Ritual (To Build)

**Goal:** Quick, low-friction reflection that fits into Obsidian.

**Components:**
1. AI reviews notes/tasks from the day
2. Capture quick journal entry
3. Surface what went well, what to improve
4. Close the day intentionally

*This is a workflow to build — see Open Tasks.*
