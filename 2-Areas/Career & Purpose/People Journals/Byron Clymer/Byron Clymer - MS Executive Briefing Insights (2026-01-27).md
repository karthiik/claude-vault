# Byron Clymer: Key Insights from Microsoft Executive Briefing
**Date:** January 27, 2026
**Context:** Lockton Objectives and Strategy Overview session at Microsoft Experience Center
**Role:** Global Chief Information Officer, Lockton

## Insurance Market Dynamics

### Revenue Model Under Pressure
- **Commissions** = percentage of premium sold
- **Fees** = services offered back to clients
- Soft markets compress broker revenue as premiums decline
- Clients shop more aggressively when they perceive broker/carrier commoditization
- TCOR - Total Cost of Risk - what Chief Risk Officers care about

### The Differentiation Imperative
> "How do you differentiate yourself? How do you make it so that you can keep the rate flat and explain to the clients that here's all the other stuff that we do for you?"

- Insurance is no longer about the policy document—it's about the **conversation and value-add**
- Brokers must reinvent themselves or become interchangeable

---

## Byron's Global Focus Framework (Strategic Slide)

This is Byron's articulation of how Lockton differentiates in a commoditizing market:

| Focus Area | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Advisory beats access** | Quantified risk narratives, coverage gap analysis, claims advocacy, and board-ready reporting become the differentiators |
| **Program engineering becomes core capability** | Layering, captives, parametric triggers, blended markets (traditional + alternative), and tighter wording control |
| **Data quality is a placement lever** | Underwriting for COPE completeness, exposure mapping, cyber controls evidence, loss runs normalization, and modeling outputs |
| **Operational excellence matters in a faster cycle** | Digital submission packs, structured data exchange, and workflow discipline to secure underwriter attention |
| **Client affordability strategy** | Retention optimization, risk improvements, phased limit buys, and multi-year structures where feasible |

---

## Advisory as Competitive Moat

### Core Principle
> "Advisory beats access."

### Advisory Capabilities That Win
- Quantified risk narratives
- Coverage gap analysis
- Claims advocacy
- Board-ready reporting

### Understanding Client Business = Non-Negotiable
- Must understand client's **industry**, **business model**, and **affordability**
- Must track global **capital markets**: Hang Seng, Indian markets, London exchange
- Clients view risk through a financial lens—broker must too
- Example: Advising on self-insurance vs. traditional coverage requires capital market fluency

---

## Program Engineering as Core Capability

### The Shift
> "Program engineering becomes core capability."

### Key Components
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mud Maps** | Risk structure visualizations—now dynamic, not static |
| **Layering** | Strategic distribution across multiple carriers |
| **Captives** | Self-insurance vehicles layered with traditional coverage |
| **Parametric Triggers** | Event-based payouts vs. traditional claims |
| **Blended Markets** | Traditional + alternative risk transfer |
| **Wording Control** | Tighter policy language precision |

### Regional Risk Intelligence
- Mining in South America: Higher claims in Lima vs. Brazil due to weaker regulatory enforcement
- Cross-border risks (e.g., mining operations spanning countries) require multi-jurisdiction expertise

---

## Data Quality as Table Stakes

### Byron's View
> "Data quality is table stakes to be able to do the advisory piece."

### Critical Data Domains
- **COPE data** (Construction, Occupancy, Protection, Exposure) for underwriting
- Exposure mapping
- Cyber controls evidence
- Loss runs normalization
- Modeling outputs
- Fleet data for marine/shipping
- Employee census across jurisdictions

### The Risk
> "Data quality—that will torpedo a deal if something is wrong."

---

## Operational Excellence

### Speed is the New Baseline
> "Operational excellence—it's a faster cycle now."

### Execution Components
- Digital submission packs
- Structured data exchange
- Workflow discipline to secure underwriter attention

---

## Client Affordability Strategy

### Tactics for Cost-Conscious Clients
- Retention optimization
- Risk improvements (reduce exposure)
- Phased limit buys
- Multi-year structures

---

## AI & Technology Transformation

### What AI Will Displace
> "The whole underwriting function that goes on with creating the policy—you can throw tons and tons of data at an AI engine and get consistent results over time. That piece is going to go away."

### Where AI Adds Massive Value
| Use Case | Byron's Insight |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Claims data mining** | Query massive claims databases: "What's the most expensive claim? What surgery goes bad most often?" |
| **Data ingestion** | Replacing third-party data entry services |
| **Endorsement analysis** | The "sweet spot"—comparing policy versions and exclusions |
| **Advisory insights** | Transforming claims patterns into client risk reduction advice |

### The AI Accuracy Challenge
> "In the AI world, it has to be 100% because it's a legal document. Once that document is signed, someone is accountable; somebody is liable. Errors and omissions become a massive deal."

---

## Lockton Business Model & Culture

### Secret Sauce
> "It's not technology. It's all about getting the right people steered in the right direction."

### The Four Pillars (from Byron's Slide)

| Pillar | Key Points |
|--------|------------|
| **01 - Organic Growth** | 13% organic growth in 2025; 94% client loyalty; "We do what we say we will do" |
| **02 - Private & Independent** | Focus on clients, not investors/analysts; Long-term decision-making = stability; Flexible, responsive, passion for service |
| **03 - Client Focus** | Client teams empowered to make decisions; Resources allocated locally; No "permission" from headquarters required |
| **04 - Flat Structure** | 20-30% more invested in front-end client service; Stable senior teams that know your business; Easy client access to experts |

### Key Metrics
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Client Loyalty** | 94% retention rate |
| **Organic Growth** | 13% CAGR; ~$500M revenue/year |
| **Ownership** | Private, family-owned—no PE pressure for returns |
| **Reinvestment** | Family reinvests profits (e.g., reinsurance: $30M → $400M revenue) |

### The Family Mindset
> "Ron Lockton has a $15 million book of business... If our data center is melting and he gets a call from his customers, he is not going to care about the data center. He's going to go meet with this client."

---

## Global Operating Model

### Philosophy
> "Think global, act local."

> "Lockton owns its operations in 36 countries worldwide, and our global capabilities extend to 156 countries through the Lockton Global Partnership. Our model was designed deliberately to provide clients access to our best expertise and resources in every country, without barriers or borders."

### Global Footprint by Region (FY25 Revenue)

| Region | Countries | FY25 Revenue |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Europe** | UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Malta, Sweden, Turkey, Bermuda, Switzerland, Italy | **$603.1M** |
| **Latin America/Caribbean** | Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia, Venezuela, Caribbean/Central America RE | **$152.6M** |
| **Asia** | China, Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore, Cambodia, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, Macau, India | **$117.6M** |
| **Pacific** | Australia, New Zealand | **$64.6M** |
| **Middle East & Africa** | UAE, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Oman, South Africa | **$64.2M** |

**Total International FY25:** ~$1.0B across 5 regions

### Regional Nuances (from Byron's Commentary)
| Region | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **Korea** | Nationalistic—will not accept risk placed in Singapore/India; must lead with local carrier |
| **Saudi Arabia (KSA)** | Strong affinity to local markets; data center coming in 6-12 months |
| **India** | Built around a 20+ year industry veteran CEO; privatized healthcare growth |
| **Canada** | Cultural sensitivity—European leadership positioning preferred over American |
| **South America** | Brazil P&C grew from $14M to $100M; strong in mining |

### Market Entry Approach
- Hire established local CEO with deep industry relationships
- Provide back-office infrastructure from London/US
- Culture-first: messaging and reporting structures matter

---

## Technology Strategy (Global CIO Perspective)

### Scaling Challenge
> "How do we create scalability across the organization? How do we not do everything differently?"

### Current State
- 18 data centers globally with fragmented hardware
- Multiple policy administration systems (by region, not global)
- Recently standardized: global laptop/device deal; common Azure tenant

### CIO Philosophy
> "IT's job is to remove the friction of technology—get rid of the friction of technology—but do it in a cost-constrained way."

### Data Strategy
> "I have to be able to get that data out so I can do analytics. How associates put that data in? I don't care. I just need to be able to get it out."

| Rank | Company | Revenue | Ownership |
|------|---------|---------|-----------|
| #1 | Marsh & McLennan | $25.33B | Public |
| #2 | Aon PLC | $15.38B | Public |
| #3 | Arthur J. Gallagher | $11.08B | Public |
| #4 | Willis Towers Watson | $9.74B | Public |

| #10 | Howden Insurance Brokers | $3.73B | PE Backed |

### The Top 20 in 2034: Ownership Breakdown
Byron posed: *"What does the top 20 list look like in 2034?"*

| Ownership Type | Companies |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Public** | Marsh & McLennan, Aon, Arthur J. Gallagher, Willis Towers Watson, Brown & Brown, Baldwin |
| **PE Backed** | Hub, Acrisure, Alliant, TIH Insurance Holdings, Howden, USI, AssuredPartners, NFP, BroadStreet, Risk Strategies, Alera, EPIC, OneDigital, PCF, Higginbotham |
| **Private** | **Lockton** (only one) |

### Strategic Insight
> Lockton is the **only private company** in the top 20—creating unique competitive positioning against PE-backed firms focused on returns over service.

### PE-Backed Competitor Vulnerability
> "What PE wants? They want a return. They're probably not servicing the clients... In a hard market, it's harder for the peanut butter spread companies to find a good price because they haven't focused on building relationships with the markets."

### Lockton's Play
> "We will undercut—we won't make money—just give us for one year. We can prove to them that we're better. Nine times out of ten... 'My god, I should have gone with you sooner.'"
