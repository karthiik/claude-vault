# Home & Environment

> Creating a home that sparks creativity and encourages healthy eating and active living — a comfortable safe haven for Vinay, and a space that feels like Jamie's home too when she visits, bridging our separate lives into shared belonging.

## Vision

### What Home Should Feel Like

| Dimension | Vision |
|-----------|--------|
| **Creativity** | Minimal, clutter-free desk. Natural light. Deep work focus. |
| **Health** | Avoid lethargy triggers. Less alcohol. Movement throughout day. |
| **Vinay** | Clean, warm, safe. Enables his creativity — playing, clarinet, studies. |
| **Jamie** | Welcoming for visits. A space that feels like hers too. |

### Core Principle

**Less is more.** A KonMari approach — minimize what's out, keep only what sparks joy or serves a purpose.

---

## Current State

### What's Working

- Workspace is in pretty good shape
- Prefer standing most of the day (healthy habit)
- Maid team starting quarterly deep cleans (Monday!)

### Gaps to Close

- **Upstairs is a mess** — needs attention
- **Guest bedroom** — full of old stuff, needs cleanout
- **General clutter** — house needs KonMari declutter pass
- **Work chair** — might need replacement (nice to have)
