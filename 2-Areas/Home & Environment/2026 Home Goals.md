# 2026 Home Goals

**Theme:** *"The year my house feels like home."*

**Parent:** [[0_Home_Environment_Index]]

---

## Annual Goals

| Goal | Outcome | Success Metric | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **HO1: KonMari the House** | Decluttered, intentional space | 4 areas completed | In progress |
| **HO2: Guest Bedroom Ready** | Space for Jamie to feel welcome | Bed + furniture in place | Not started |
| **HO3: Office Upgrade** | Comfortable workspace | New desk chair | Not started |

## The Vision

A sanctuary — organized, intentional, supports your best self.

**The trap:** Clutter accumulates. Spaces become storage instead of living areas. The house feels like a place you stay, not a place you live.

**The fix:** KonMari each area. Make intentional choices. Create a home that welcomes you and the people you love.

## Weekly Review Questions

*Ask yourself each Monday:*

1. Is any clutter accumulating?
2. Does each room feel intentional?
3. What's the next KonMari area?

---

## The Home Test

At the end of 2026, ask:

- Does walking in the door feel good?
- Is there a place for everything?
- Does Jamie feel at home when she visits?
- Did I finish what I started?

If yes → the house became a home.
