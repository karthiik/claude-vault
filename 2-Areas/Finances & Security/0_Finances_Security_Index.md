> Building toward freedom at 55-60 — the ability to travel, stay active, pursue passion projects, and leave a legacy that sets Vinay up for life

---

## Vision

### Freedom at 55-60

Not retirement — **freedom**. Work becomes optional, not obligatory.

**The Picture:**
- 2-3 international trips a year
- Motorcycle riding a few times a week
- Passion projects and creative pursuits
- Playing with tech, helping others
- Maybe some consulting (on my terms)
- Simple, minimalistic lifestyle
- Location: tech access + surrounded by nature
- Vinay finishing college, launching his career

### Legacy for Vinay

Three-fold:

1. **Financial foundation** — Education funded, a head start to build on
2. **Independence** — He doesn't have to worry about me
3. **Financial wisdom** — Teaching him how to use and invest money wisely

The goal isn't just to *leave* him wealth — it's to *teach* him how wealth works.

## Current State

### What's Working

| Strength | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Emergency savings | ✓ In place |
| Diversified income portfolio | ✓ Active |
| Year-over-year progress | ✓ On trajectory |
| Retirement contributions | ✓ Catching up |

### The Gap

- **Started retirement savings late** — but making up ground
- **Need progressive income increases** over the next 5-10 years to hit freedom target
- **Spending tracking** — tools exist (Origin, YNAB), but habit isn't consistent

### Honest Assessment

The fundamentals are solid. The path forward is:
1. **Sustained income growth** (ties to Career — CTO trajectory, external visibility = leverage)
2. **Consistent spending awareness** (monthly review habit)
3. **Teaching Vinay** (ongoing)

## 2026 Focus

> **Theme:** *"The year of minimalism and saving more."*

| Priority | Target | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **Income growth** | 20-25% increase over current | In progress |
| **Monthly finance reviews** | 12 of 12 months | Not started |
| **Vinay financial education** | Introduce ETF trading | Ongoing |

**→ [[2026 Finances Goals]]** — Full cascade: goals, quarterly intentions, monthly milestones

### How Income Growth Happens

The 20-25% income increase ties directly to [[0_Career_Purpose_Index|Career & Purpose]]:
- CTO trajectory progression
- External visibility (speaking, publishing) = market leverage
- Role transition / negotiation opportunities

---

## Habits & Routines

| Cadence | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| **Monthly** | Finance review — spending, savings, trajectory check |
| **Quarterly** | Portfolio review — diversification, rebalancing |
| **Ongoing** | Money conversations with Vinay |

### Monthly Finance Review

**Tools:** Origin, YNAB

**The check-in:**
1. Review spending categories — any surprises?
2. Check savings rate — on target?
3. Update net worth tracker
4. One optimization action

**When:** First weekend of each month

## Financial Principles

*Beliefs that guide decisions:*

1. **Freedom over wealth** — The goal isn't maximum accumulation; it's optionality
2. **Minimalism enables freedom** — Lower expenses = earlier freedom
3. **Income is the lever** — At this stage, growing income matters more than cutting expenses
4. **Teach, don't just give** — Vinay learns by doing, not receiving
5. **Diversification is protection** — Multiple income streams reduce risk
