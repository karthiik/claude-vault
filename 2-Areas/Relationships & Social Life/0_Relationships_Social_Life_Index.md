# Relationships & Social Life

> Deep connection and trust with the people who matter most — Jamie and Vinay at the center, showing up fully for both despite distance and life's demands.

---

## Vision

### The Picture (5 Years)

**Jamie:** A partnership where neither feels alone despite distance — mutual support for each other's growth, shared adventures, and a rhythm that keeps us connected even when apart.

**Vinay:** A young man who knows his dad is present, invested, and proud. Someone who's seen the world with me, learned real skills alongside me, and knows he can always come to me.

### What Success Looks Like

- Jamie never questions whether she's a priority
- Vinay has memories of adventures together, not just cohabitation
- Both relationships have *rhythm* — not just reactive catch-ups
