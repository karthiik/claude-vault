# 2026 Joy Goals

**Theme:** *"The year of adventures, not excuses."*

**Parent:** [[0_Joy_Creativity_Play_Index]]

## Annual Goals

| Goal | Outcome | Success Metric | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **J1: Protect the Big Adventures** | Don't let life squeeze out what matters | National moto trip + India/Dubai + local trips | In progress |
| **J2: Ride When the Weather is Nice** | Motorcycle doesn't sit unused | Regular local rides, no excuses | Not started |
| **J3: More Small Joys with Jamie** | Presence in the moments | More sunsets, walks, park time in KC | Not started |

---

## What Makes Me Feel Alive

Two sources:
1. **Like-minded people** — the energy of collaboration, shared passion
2. **Nature** — with Jamie, with Skai, or solo

**The trap:** When work gets busy, Joy is the first thing to go. The motorcycle sits. The walks don't happen. The sunsets get missed.

**The fix:** Protect it. Schedule it. No excuses.
