# Joy, Creativity & Play

> Chasing aliveness — through the spark of problem-solving with a team, the exhilaration of riding my motorcycle in breathtaking environments, and immersing in nature's beauty to refresh my mind and gain new perspective on life and the world.

## Vision

### What Makes Me Feel Alive

Two sources of aliveness:
1. **Like-minded people** — the energy of collaboration, shared passion
2. **Nature** — with Jamie, with Skai, or solo

### What "Enough" Looks Like

| Type | Target |
|------|--------|
| International trips | 2 per year |
| Adventure motorcycle trip | 1 per year |
| Local trips with Jamie | A few per year |

---

## Current State

### What's Working

- International travel happening (1 last year, India/Dubai planned)
- Local trip with Jamie coming (January)
- Small joys exist: sunset watching, park walks with Jamie and Skai

### Gap to Close

**Motorcycle riding gets squeezed when life gets busy.**

This is the first thing to go under pressure — the adventure that feeds the soul but feels "optional" when work demands pile up.

## 2026 Focus

| Priority | Target | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Protect the motorcycle trip — don't let it get squeezed | Planned (national trip booked) |
| 2 | India/Dubai with Jamie | Planning (summer) |
| 3 | Local trips with Jamie | January planned, more TBD |
