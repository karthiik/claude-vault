## 2026 Word of the Year

> **Emergence**

*Stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself. Emerging from internal credibility to external impact. Rising into the CTO chapter while staying grounded in what matters.*

**Jamie's word:** Abundance — *we rise together, each in our own way.*

## Principles to Carry Forward

*Lessons that apply across all areas:*

1. **Intuition is the Compass** — Trust your gut; listen for what truly fits rather than forcing outcomes
2. **Boundaries Protect Peace** — Maintain distance from what drains; protect your energy
3. **Presence Over Perfection** — Choose to be present, even with limitations
4. **Alignment Over Speed** — Quiet momentum beats rushing; mind, body, spirit are interconnected
5. **Environment Matters** — Home as sanctuary underpins wellbeing
6. **Vulnerability is Strength** — Sharing your story makes you a leader of human experience
