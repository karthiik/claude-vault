## 2026 Word of the Year

> **Emergence**

*Stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself. Emerging from internal credibility to external impact. Rising into the CTO chapter while staying grounded in what matters.*

**Jamie's word:** Abundance — *we rise together, each in our own way.*

## The Full Circle

```
                Health – Mind, Body & Spirit
                          |
Education & Learning -----+---- Relationships & Social Life
              \           |           /
               \          |          /
    Home & Environment ---+--- Career & Purpose
               /          |          \
              /           |           \
Joy, Creativity & Play ---+--- Finances & Security
                          |
               Contribution & Legacy
```

**Philosophy:** No part of life exists in a vacuum. Health underpins career; career provides security for home; home is the sanctuary for relationships; relationships fuel joy. By nurturing each area with equal intentionality, we move from "fragmented effort" to "harmonious flow."

## Principles to Carry Forward

*Lessons that apply across all areas:*

1. **Intuition is the Compass** — Trust your gut; listen for what truly fits rather than forcing outcomes
2. **Boundaries Protect Peace** — Maintain distance from what drains; protect your energy
3. **Presence Over Perfection** — Choose to be present, even with limitations
4. **Alignment Over Speed** — Quiet momentum beats rushing; mind, body, spirit are interconnected
5. **Environment Matters** — Home as sanctuary underpins wellbeing
6. **Vulnerability is Strength** — Sharing your story makes you a leader of human experience

## Review Cadence

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| **Weekly** | Quick scan — anything urgent? Any area neglected? |
| **Monthly** | Check each area — where's the imbalance? |
| **Quarterly** | Deep review — adjust goals and intentions |
| **Annually** | Life audit — new Word of the Year, reset intentions |

## How Areas Connect

**Areas ↔ Projects:**
- **Areas** = ongoing (no end date)
- **Projects** = time-bound efforts with clear outcomes

| 2026 GAS Summit | Career & Purpose |
| London Trip | Joy, Creativity & Play, Relationships & Social Life |
| India/Dubai Trip | Joy, Creativity & Play, Relationships & Social Life |
| EJ College Transition | Relationships & Social Life |

**Areas ↔ Each Other:**
- Health → enables → Career performance
- Career → provides → Financial security
- Finances → enables → Home (environment)
- Home → supports → Health recovery
- Relationships → fuel → Joy
- Learning → accelerates → Career growth
- Contribution → deepens → Relationships

## Building Out Areas

Each Area index should include:

1. **Intention** — One sentence: "I am [verb]-ing..."
2. **Vision** — What does thriving look like here?
3. **Current State** — Where am I now?
4. **2026 Focus** — Key priorities for this year
5. **Habits/Routines** — What maintains this area?
6. **Active Projects** — What's in flight?
7. **Open Tasks** — What needs attention?

Use [[Career Coaching Methodology]] as a template for building out other areas.
