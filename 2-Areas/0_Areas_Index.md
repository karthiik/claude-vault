## 2026 Word of the Year

> **Emergence**

*Stepping into visibility — as a thought leader, innovator, and the next version of myself. Emerging from internal credibility to external impact. Rising into the CTO chapter while staying grounded in what matters.*

**Jamie's word:** Abundance — *we rise together, each in our own way.*

## Principles to Carry Forward

*Lessons learned — reminders for when things get hard:*

1. **Trust Your Gut** — You're only human. Intuition is your compass — listen to what feels right rather than overthinking or forcing outcomes
2. **Choose You First** — Do what feels right to you, not what makes someone else happy. Your peace matters
3. **Decide and Move** — Be confident in the decisions you make. Once you've decided, commit — don't rethink or second-guess
4. **Journal for Clarity** — Practice mindfulness by writing regularly. Processing thoughts on paper keeps you grounded and present
5. **Practice Gratitude** — Remember all that you have in your life. Gratitude shifts perspective from scarcity to abundance
6. **Break the Pattern** — You've let health slip before — eating, activity, strength. Name it, remember it, don't repeat it this year
