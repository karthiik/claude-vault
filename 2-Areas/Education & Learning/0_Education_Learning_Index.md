# Education & Learning

> Growing into a well-rounded leader who communicates and articulates with clarity, treats people with empathy and thoughtfulness, shows up fully present in every conversation, and continuously learns how to be the best version of myself across all areas of life.

## Vision

### The Picture (5 Years)

A well-respected technology leader who is invited for speaking engagements because I can be inspiring, funny, and can advise businesses on how best to leverage technology to get the outcomes they need.

### The Gap

The gap isn't *input* — I consume plenty of research and material. The gap is **synthesis into output**. Finding topics that resonate, using Substack to incrementally build content that becomes speaking material and eventually a book.

**The flywheel:** Research → Substack post → refine what resonates → speaking content → book

## Current State

### What's Working

- **Reading habit:** 10-15 min morning + 10-15 min night (established)
- **AI experimentation:** Daily at work, built into workflow
- **Consumption:** Plenty of research and material intake

### Gaps to Close

- **Writing/synthesis cadence:** No regular habit for turning learning into content
- **MIT time management:** Need to see workload and adjust schedule starting March
- **Topic finding:** Need help identifying topics that will resonate with audience
