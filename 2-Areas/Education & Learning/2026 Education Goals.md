# 2026 Education Goals

**Theme:** *"The year I turned learning into teaching."*

**Parent:** [[0_Education_Learning_Index]]

---

## Annual Goals

| Goal | Outcome | Success Metric | Status |
|------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **E1: MIT CTO Program** | Technology innovation leadership skills | Complete program, apply learnings | Not started |

| **E3: AI Mastery** | Stay current, build solutions | Continuous experimentation + practical applications | Ongoing |

## The Flywheel

> Learning → Synthesis → Teaching → Impact

The gap isn't input — you consume plenty. The gap is turning learning into *output* that helps others.

```
Research/Reading → Substack Review → Refine What Resonates → Speaking Content → Book (someday)
```

Every book review is practice for the larger content creation muscle.
