# Shared Reasoning Log

This is the council's live thinking space. When agents gather, they document their reasoning HERE as they work — not after.

---

## Protocol

When `agents gather` is invoked:

1. **Create a new session block** with timestamp and idea summary
2. **Each agent writes to this file AS they reason** — in parallel
3. **Document the journey, not just the destination:**
   - Initial reaction to the idea
   - Each step of logic ("I noticed X, which means Y...")
   - Decision points ("Considered A vs B, went with A because...")
   - Key insights discovered along the way
   - Doubts or uncertainties
4. **Persist everything** — even dead ends and revised thinking
5. **Conclude with final position** after reasoning is complete

This creates a transparent record of HOW conclusions were reached.

### 2026-01-25 — AI Avatar Academy Platform

**Full analysis saved to:** [[3-Resources/Research/2026-01-25 AI Avatar Academy - Council Analysis]]

**Idea Summary:** Create "AI Avatar Academy" — an automated educational platform that:
- Runs scheduled cron jobs to monitor new AI/GenAI content (Google Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI updates, trending X content)
- Scrapes information and documentation automatically
- Uses HeyGen API to create AI avatar clone videos of the user
- Auto-generates an ever-growing library of video tutorials
- Includes a knowledge-based chatbot with the same content knowledge
- Is transparent that all content is AI-generated

**Core Value Proposition:** Users get an always-current, ever-expanding library of AI tutorials narrated by a consistent avatar, plus conversational access to the same knowledge.

### Council Analysis in Progress...

> [!success] 🟢 Optimist Agent
> **Perspective:** Best-case extrapolation
>
> **Thinking aloud:**
>
> - Starting with the core insight: AI education is exploding, but the content creation bottleneck is REAL. Most thought leaders can't keep up with the pace of change. What if you could have an army of yourself, teaching 24/7?
>
> - I noticed that this idea combines several powerful trends simultaneously: (1) AI avatar technology reaching "good enough" quality, (2) insatiable demand for AI education, (3) the rise of personal brands in tech, and (4) automation reducing marginal cost to near-zero. When multiple trends converge like this, the timing could be exceptional.
>
> - This reminds me of how the first MOOCs (Coursera, Udemy) scaled education by recording once and distributing infinitely. But they still required manual content creation. This takes it a step further — the content CREATES ITSELF. That's a fundamentally different unit economics model.
>
> - Let me think about Karthik's positioning here... SVP of Architecture with 20+ years in enterprise tech, AWS certified, currently in MIT's CTO program, recognized speaker and mentor. This isn't some random creator — this is someone with CREDIBILITY in enterprise circles. The avatar isn't pretending to be an expert; it's cloning an actual expert. That's a crucial differentiation.
>
> - Thinking about the automation pipeline: cron jobs → content scraping → synthesis → script generation → HeyGen video → publish. Each step can be monitored and quality-gated. The key insight is that THIS IS A COMPOUNDING SYSTEM. Every day, the library grows. Every update from OpenAI or Anthropic becomes a new video within hours. Competitors who create content manually simply cannot match this velocity.
>
> - The transparency angle is actually a FEATURE, not a bug. "This content is AI-generated by my digital twin" positions Karthik as innovative and honest. It's meta — teaching AI using AI. The authenticity paradox: being transparent about inauthenticity creates a different kind of authenticity.
>
> - Considering the chatbot component... This is the sleeper feature. Videos are great for passive consumption, but the chatbot enables ACTIVE learning. "Explain embeddings to me like I'm a PM." "How does this relate to what I learned yesterday?" The chatbot has context across ALL the generated content. It becomes a personalized tutor.
>
> - Market timing analysis: We're at the point where AI literacy is becoming mandatory for career survival, but high-quality, current content is scarce. By the time this market is saturated (3-5 years?), an automated system will have built an insurmountable content library. First-mover advantage with compounding returns.
>
> - Revenue model possibilities at scale: (1) Subscription for full library access, (2) Enterprise licensing for corporate training, (3) White-label the platform itself, (4) Consulting leads from demonstrated expertise, (5) Affiliate revenue from tool recommendations. Multiple monetization paths reduce risk.
>
> **The Upside:** At maximum scale, this becomes THE go-to resource for enterprise AI education. Imagine: 10,000+ hours of current, searchable video content covering every major AI development, narrated by a recognizable industry expert avatar, with a conversational AI that can answer any question about the corpus. Enterprise deals with Fortune 500s for employee training. A personal brand that scales infinitely without burning out. Passive income that compounds while you sleep. Speaking opportunities and book deals that cite the platform as proof of authority. Eventually, the platform architecture itself becomes a product — white-labeled to other thought leaders who want to scale their own expertise.
>
> **For This to Work:**
> 1. **HeyGen quality must be convincing enough** — The avatar needs to clear the "uncanny valley" threshold. If it looks robotic or sounds off, credibility collapses. Current HeyGen quality is good but not perfect. This matters less for educational content than for, say, sales videos.
>
> 2. **Content synthesis must maintain accuracy** — Automated scraping and summarization can introduce errors. One factually wrong video damages trust. Need robust fact-checking layer, possibly human review for technical accuracy before publish.
>
> 3. **SEO and discovery must work** — A library no one finds is worthless. Need strong YouTube/platform strategy, consistent posting schedule, cross-promotion through existing channels (LinkedIn, X), and the chatbot as a discoverability engine.
>
> 4. **Legal/copyright clarity on scraping** — Need to ensure content sourcing is on solid legal ground. Transformative use for education is generally protected, but documentation scraping needs to respect ToS.
>
> 5. **Differentiation from free content** — OpenAI and Anthropic release their own docs and tutorials. The value-add is: (a) synthesis across sources, (b) enterprise perspective, (c) practical implementation focus, (d) the conversational chatbot interface.
>
> **Precedent:**
> - Lex Fridman built massive reach through consistent AI content, but he records manually — imagine if that were automated
> - Fireship on YouTube has shown that short, punchy AI explainers are massively popular — this automates that format
> - AI-generated news sites (though ethically questionable) have proven the technical feasibility of automated content at scale
> - Synthesia and HeyGen already have enterprise customers using avatar videos for training
>
> **Leverage Points:**
> 1. **Karthik's existing credibility and network** — The avatar isn't starting from zero. SVP title, MIT program, speaking experience means built-in trust and distribution channels (LinkedIn followers, professional network, conference invitations)
>
> 2. **Compound velocity advantage** — Every day the system runs, competitors fall further behind. A 6-month head start could mean 1,000+ more videos than any manual creator. At some point, the library itself becomes a moat.
>
> **Conclusion:** The best-case scenario is transformative — Karthik becomes the definitive voice in enterprise AI education, with a content library that grows automatically and generates revenue 24/7. The platform eventually becomes a product itself, white-labeled to other thought leaders. The key requirements are: avatar quality clearing the credibility threshold, robust accuracy checking, and strong initial distribution through existing professional networks. The market timing is excellent — AI education demand is at all-time highs while supply struggles to keep pace. A first-mover who combines automation + credibility + transparency can build a lasting moat. This isn't a side project; this could become the primary identity and income stream within 2-3 years.

> [!danger] 🔴 Pessimist Agent
> **Perspective:** Worst-case extrapolation
>
> **Thinking aloud:**
>
> Let me start by unpacking what this platform actually requires to work. I'm seeing multiple interconnected systems, each with its own failure modes. The question isn't whether something will go wrong — it's which failure cascades into catastrophe.
>
> First instinct: this has a lot of moving parts. Cron jobs, web scraping, LLM processing, video generation APIs, hosting, chatbot infrastructure. Each is a potential failure point. But let me think about which ones are existential versus merely annoying.
>
> **Starting with the legal/copyright angle...**
>
> The idea involves scraping Google, Anthropic, OpenAI documentation plus "trending X content." Right away I see landmines:
> - X (Twitter) has aggressively pursued scrapers post-Musk acquisition. They've already sued multiple companies. Automated scraping violates their ToS explicitly.
> - Documentation scraping sits in a gray area. While docs are public, bulk automated scraping for commercial content generation could trigger DMCA claims, especially if the generated videos reproduce substantial portions.
> - The worst case: a cease-and-desist from one of the AI giants. If OpenAI or Google sends legal notice, the entire content pipeline stops. You're not just risking the scraped content — you're risking the relationship with the ecosystem you're trying to cover.
>
> Wait, this is worse than I initially thought. If Karthik builds a reputation as "the AI educator" and then gets publicly called out by OpenAI for unauthorized content scraping... that's not just platform death, that's career reputation damage. He's SVP at Lockton. Enterprise clients notice these things.
>
> **Now the HeyGen avatar angle...**
>
> HeyGen is a paid service. Looking at their pricing model:
> - Video generation costs scale with duration and quality
> - "Ever-growing library" means ever-growing costs
> - No volume caps means potential runaway expenses
>
> The risk here is subtle but deadly: if the platform gains traction, video generation costs explode before monetization catches up. You could be bleeding $1000+/month on video generation alone while the audience is still building. Classic startup death spiral — the better you do, the faster you die.
>
> Also, HeyGen's ToS almost certainly prohibits automated bulk generation. If they detect programmatic abuse of their API, account termination is likely. Then you've got a library of videos you can't add to, with an avatar you can't recreate elsewhere.
>
> **The quality control problem...**
>
> This is where I see the most insidious failure mode. Automated content generation WILL produce errors. LLMs hallucinate. Scraped content can be outdated within hours (AI moves FAST).
>
> Imagine this sequence:
> 1. Platform scrapes an OpenAI blog post about a new feature
> 2. LLM generates a tutorial script with a subtle misunderstanding
> 3. Avatar video goes live automatically
> 4. Feature gets changed or the tutorial has incorrect information
> 5. Someone follows the tutorial, breaks their production system
> 6. They publicly blame the platform
>
> Now multiply this by hundreds of auto-generated videos. The error surface area is enormous. One wrong video that goes viral for the wrong reasons could crater trust permanently.
>
> "I've seen this fail when..." — this reminds me of content farms that scaled quantity over quality. They work until Google's algorithm catches on, then they crater. Same dynamic here but worse because it's VIDEO content tied to a personal avatar/brand.
>
> **The deepfake/trust dimension...**
>
> Here's something uncomfortable: an AI avatar saying "I'm AI-generated" still looks like Karthik. It uses his face, his voice pattern. Even with transparency:
> - People skim. They won't always catch the disclosure.
> - The avatar creates parasocial connection regardless of disclosure
> - If the avatar says something wrong or controversial, it's Karthik's face saying it
>
> Worst case: an edge case in the content pipeline produces something offensive or incorrect. Maybe the LLM misinterprets something, maybe scraped content includes something problematic. The avatar — Karthik's face — delivers it confidently. Even if it's corrected later, screenshots live forever.
>
> I've seen this pattern with AI chatbots. Microsoft's Tay. Google's Bard launch. Automated systems producing embarrassing outputs at scale. The difference here is it's attached to a real person's identity and professional reputation.
>
> **Technical complexity and maintenance burden...**
>
> Let me count the systems that need to stay working:
> 1. Web scraping infrastructure (multiple sources, different formats)
> 2. LLM processing pipeline (prompts, quality filters, summarization)
> 3. Script generation logic
> 4. HeyGen API integration
> 5. Video hosting/CDN
> 6. Chatbot knowledge base
> 7. Chatbot inference infrastructure
> 8. Scheduling/orchestration layer
> 9. Monitoring/alerting
> 10. User-facing platform (web app?)
>
> This is a full engineering team's worth of systems for a side project. The maintenance burden alone could consume 10-20 hours/week. If Karthik's day job demands attention (and SVP roles do), the system rots. Scrapers break when sites change. APIs deprecate. LLM outputs drift. One by one, the videos start getting worse, the chatbot gets stale, the platform becomes embarrassing.
>
> The worst case isn't a dramatic failure — it's slow decay into irrelevance while still bearing the infrastructure costs.
>
> **Competition and market dynamics...**
>
> The AI education space is brutally competitive. Fireship, Lex Fridman, Two Minute Papers, countless YouTubers — they're putting out high-quality, human-crafted content. Can an automated system compete on quality? Probably not.
>
> Can it compete on speed? Maybe for a moment. But the big players will adopt similar automation. OpenAI is already generating video content. Google has AI-powered content tools. Racing against the AI companies... using their AI... to cover their AI... that's not a sustainable moat.
>
> **The reputational stake...**
>
> This connects everything. Karthik isn't an anonymous startup founder — he's a recognized leader in enterprise tech. His reputation is his career asset. If AI Avatar Academy:
> - Gets sued → career risk
> - Produces embarrassing content → career risk
> - Becomes known as "that AI spam guy" → career risk
> - Fails publicly → career risk
>
> The asymmetry is brutal. Success = modest upside (additional revenue stream, thought leadership). Failure = potential damage to 20+ years of professional reputation.
>
> **The Downside:** Full-scale failure looks like this: The platform launches, generates initial buzz. Then a combination of events cascade:
> - Legal notice from a content source forces takedown of 30% of videos
> - HeyGen detects automated abuse, throttles or terminates API access
> - A tutorial with incorrect information goes viral (negatively), with Karthik's AI face confidently explaining something wrong
> - The story gets picked up by AI ethics commentators as an example of "deepfake education risks"
> - Enterprise clients at Lockton start asking questions about their SVP's side project
> - The platform becomes a liability that needs to be shut down publicly, cementing the narrative
>
> **For This to Fail:**
> 1. **Legal exposure from scraping** — One cease-and-desist from a major AI company creates existential and reputational risk. The platform depends on content it doesn't own.
> 2. **Quality control at scale becomes impossible** — Automated systems produce errors. In fast-moving AI space, "correct yesterday, wrong today" is constant. No human review = guaranteed embarrassing outputs.
> 3. **Cost-scaling outpaces revenue** — HeyGen costs grow linearly with content. Revenue (if any) grows slowly. Classic cash flow death spiral for content businesses.
> 4. **Avatar creates personal liability** — Unlike anonymous content, this is Karthik's face. Every error, controversy, or failure is personally attached to a senior executive's identity.
>
> **Precedent:**
> - **Content farms (Demand Media, eHow)** — Scaled quantity over quality, dominated briefly, then crushed by algorithm changes and quality competitors. The automated approach works until it doesn't.
> - **AI chatbot PR disasters (Tay, early Bard)** — Automated content systems produce unpredictable outputs. When attached to brands, the damage is immediate and lasting.
> - **Deepfake concerns in education** — There's growing regulatory and social pushback against synthetic media. Being early doesn't mean being safe — it might mean being the example case for new restrictions.
>
> **Kill Shots:**
> 1. **A single viral embarrassment** — One video where the AI avatar confidently explains something completely wrong, harmful, or offensive. Screenshot spreads. "Lockton SVP's AI clone spreads misinformation" becomes the headline. There's no recovery from that.
> 2. **Platform dependency collapse** — HeyGen changes pricing, APIs, or ToS. Suddenly the entire content library can't be maintained or expanded. You've built on rented land.
>
> **Conclusion:** The worst outcome is reputational damage that outlasts the project itself. The platform dies (from legal, technical, or quality issues) but leaves behind a permanent association between Karthik's professional identity and "AI content gone wrong." The asymmetry is severe: modest upside potential versus catastrophic downside exposure. Every automated system in this stack is a vector for uncontrolled outputs attached to a real person's face and name. The question isn't whether something will go wrong — it's whether the failure mode is recoverable. Many of these aren't.

> [!info] 🔵 Realist Agent
> **Perspective:** Most-likely extrapolation
>
> **Thinking aloud:**
>
> Interesting — I've now read both the Optimist and Pessimist perspectives. Let me cut through to what's PROBABLE, not just possible.
>
> Starting with the base rate question: How do automated content platforms typically fare?
>
> - First instinct — this is a "content flywheel" play. The idea is appealing because it promises passive scaling: set up automation, watch the library grow. But I've seen this pattern before. Let me trace what typically happens...
>
> - "The base rate for automated content businesses is... mixed." Most fail not on the technical side, but on distribution. You can generate infinite content, but getting eyeballs is the hard part. YouTube is flooded with AI tutorial content already. The question isn't "can we make more content?" — it's "why would anyone choose THIS content over the thousands of free alternatives?"
>
> - Let me think about Karthik's actual situation. He's an SVP at Lockton. That's a demanding job. 20+ years in insurance tech. MIT CTO Program. His time is genuinely scarce and genuinely valuable. The appeal of automation here is obvious — he doesn't have TIME to be a content creator manually. But does automation solve the right problem?
>
> - "The key variable is... differentiation." What makes Karthik's avatar tutorials more valuable than:
>   1. Official documentation (which is free and authoritative)
>   2. Free YouTube tutorials from established creators
>   3. ChatGPT/Claude directly answering questions
>   4. Other AI-generated content that will inevitably exist
>
> - Hmm. The avatar itself isn't differentiation — it's just a delivery mechanism. The knowledge isn't differentiation either — it's scraped from public sources. The "always current" angle has potential, but that's a feature, not a moat.
>
> - Let me consider the technical feasibility. HeyGen API costs: roughly $100-500/month for business tiers. Scraping infrastructure: could be built, but requires maintenance. LLM costs for processing: variable but manageable. Video hosting: significant at scale. Total ongoing costs: probably $300-1000/month minimum to run at any meaningful scale. Not prohibitive, but also not trivial for a side project.
>
> - What does the conversion funnel look like? Free content → paid subscription? One-time course purchase? Enterprise licensing? Each model has different dynamics:
>   - **Subscription**: Needs constant value delivery. Churn is brutal. Most educational subscriptions have 70-80% annual churn.
>   - **Course purchase**: One-time revenue but needs marketing. Customer acquisition cost in education is high.
>   - **Enterprise**: Best margins, but requires sales effort and credentialing that takes time to build.
>
> - The "knowledge chatbot" addition is interesting. That's actually more defensible than the video library. A fine-tuned bot that can answer questions about specific AI tools in a conversational way... that has utility. But it's also commoditizing fast — every documentation site will have this within 18 months.
>
> - Let me think about what "success" realistically looks like in 6-12 months:
>   - **Optimistic-realistic:** 500-2000 subscribers at $10-20/month = $5K-40K/year revenue. Covers costs, provides some income, establishes credibility.
>   - **Median-realistic:** 100-300 subscribers, maybe $1K-5K/year. Doesn't cover hosting costs fully. Becomes a "hobby that pays for itself" at best.
>   - **Pessimistic-realistic:** Platform built, content generated, but less than 50 paying users. Becomes a portfolio piece/experiment rather than a business.
>
> - Wait — I should consider the personal brand angle. Karthik is building toward visible, human-centered leadership. An AI avatar academy could be a credibility play rather than a revenue play. "The SVP who built his own AI education platform" is a story. That has value in speaking engagements, career positioning, and network building.
>
> - But here's the tension: if the goal is personal brand, why automate? The most valuable personal brand content is authentic, opinionated, and human. An AI avatar reading scraped documentation is the opposite of that. The format undermines the goal.
>
> - Let me reconsider the MVP. What's the minimum version that tests the core hypothesis? Probably:
>   1. Pick ONE AI tool (say, Claude or Cursor)
>   2. Generate 10-20 videos manually (or semi-automated)
>   3. Put them on YouTube (free distribution)
>   4. See if anyone watches
>   5. THEN decide whether to automate and scale
>
> - The risk of building the full automation stack first is classic premature optimization. You're solving "scale" before validating "demand."
>
> - Competition analysis: Fireship, Traversy Media, freeCodeCamp, The AI Advantage, Matt Wolfe — they have established audiences, production quality, and trust. They're also NOT using AI avatars — because viewers still prefer human creators for educational content. The AI avatar might actually be a disadvantage in this market.
>
> - However... the "transparent AI-generated" angle could be interesting if positioned correctly. "This is an experiment in AI-generated education" is more compelling than "watch my avatar teach you." The meta-narrative has value.
>
> - The Pessimist raised valid concerns about legal/reputational risk. Let me weight those realistically. The probability of a catastrophic legal action is low (5-15%) but non-zero. The probability of embarrassing content is medium (30-50% over time) but usually recoverable with quick correction. The reputational concerns are real but perhaps overstated — side projects are common for executives, and transparent experimentation is generally viewed positively in tech circles.
>
> - The Optimist's vision of "definitive voice in enterprise AI education" is possible but unlikely (<10% probability). That outcome requires exceptional execution AND market timing AND sustained effort over years.
>
> **The Probable Outcome:** [Expected case — what actually happens in the median scenario?]
>
> In the median scenario, Karthik builds an MVP over 2-3 months of weekends and evenings. The platform works technically — videos get generated, chatbot functions. Initial launch gets 50-200 signups (mostly from his professional network and social media posts). After 6 months, active usage settles to 20-50 users. Revenue (if monetized) is $500-2K/year — not enough to justify the ongoing maintenance, but enough to keep it running.
>
> The platform becomes a talking point in Karthik's professional narrative — "I built an AI-powered education platform" — which has genuine value for his career positioning, speaking opportunities, and credibility in the AI/innovation space. It does NOT become a significant income stream or a scalable business.
>
> After 12-18 months, one of three things happens:
> 1. It gets folded into a larger opportunity (acquired by an EdTech, becomes part of a consulting offering, or gets incorporated into his employer's innovation portfolio)
> 2. It pivots to something more defensible (like enterprise training for specific organizations)
> 3. It winds down as maintenance burden exceeds value
>
> **Pivot Points:**
> 1. **Distribution strategy** — If he can leverage his professional network and LinkedIn presence effectively → modest success. If he relies on organic discovery → obscurity.
> 2. **Differentiation** — If he adds genuine editorial voice and curation (not just scraped content) → value proposition improves. If it's pure automation → commodity.
> 3. **Time commitment** — If he can genuinely limit this to 5-10 hours/week → sustainable. If it creeps into 15-20+ hours → unsustainable and damages his primary career.
> 4. **Monetization timing** — If he launches free first to build audience, then monetizes → harder but more sustainable. If he gates from day one → smaller audience but cleaner signal on willingness to pay.
> 5. **Technical debt** — If APIs (HeyGen, scraping targets, LLMs) remain stable and affordable → smooth operation. If any of them change terms, raise prices, or break → significant rebuilding required.
>
> **Base Rate:** [How do similar things usually turn out?]
>
> - Most automated content platforms fail to achieve profitability (>80%)
> - Most side projects by busy executives get abandoned within 12 months (>70%)
> - Most educational content businesses take 2-3 years to reach sustainability
> - AI avatar technology is improving but still sits in the "uncanny valley" for many viewers
> - The AI education space is extremely crowded and commoditizing rapidly
>
> Similar projects (automated content, AI avatars, educational platforms) typically follow the pattern: initial enthusiasm → technical MVP → underwhelming traction → pivot or abandon. The ones that succeed usually do so by finding a specific niche (B2B training for enterprises, specific professional certifications, etc.) rather than competing in general AI education.
>
> **The Real Decision:** [Strip away noise — what is actually being decided?]
>
> This isn't really a business decision. It's a time allocation decision.
>
> The real question is: "Given my limited discretionary hours, is building an automated AI education platform the highest-value use of my time for my goals?"
>
> If the goal is **income**, probably not — consulting, coaching, or writing would have better ROI.
> If the goal is **personal brand/credibility**, maybe — but manual, opinionated content would be more effective.
> If the goal is **learning and experimentation**, yes — this is a legitimate way to learn about AI automation, content systems, and product building.
> If the goal is **creating a business asset**, uncertain — depends entirely on execution and market timing.
>
> **Key Unknowns:** [What information would change the analysis?]
>
> 1. **Actual time availability** — How many hours/week can Karthik realistically commit for 12+ months?
> 2. **Primary motivation** — Is this about money, learning, credibility, or something else?
> 3. **Existing audience size** — How many people already follow Karthik's content? This determines day-one distribution.
> 4. **Technical skill level** — Can he build the MVP himself, or does he need to hire/outsource?
> 5. **Risk tolerance** — Is $5-10K in year-one costs acceptable for an experiment that may not return it?
> 6. **Opportunity cost** — What else would he do with these hours if not this project?
>
> **Conclusion:** [Most likely outcome + what shifts it either direction]
>
> **Most likely outcome:** The AI Avatar Academy gets built as an MVP, generates modest interest from Karthik's professional network, but never achieves escape velocity as a standalone business. It becomes a portfolio piece and credibility asset rather than a revenue-generating platform. Total outcome: break-even to small loss financially, but positive ROI on learning and professional positioning.
>
> **What shifts it toward success:**
> - Tight niche focus (e.g., "AI tools for insurance executives" rather than general AI education)
> - Strong editorial voice layered on top of automation
> - Enterprise B2B pivot with existing professional relationships
> - Early partnership with an established EdTech platform
>
> **What shifts it toward failure:**
> - Trying to compete in general AI education against established creators
> - Over-investing in automation before validating demand
> - Underestimating ongoing maintenance and content quality requirements
> - Time commitment creep that affects primary career
>
> **The probabilist's recommendation:** Build a minimal manual version first (5-10 videos, no automation). Test on YouTube for free. Measure engagement. THEN decide whether the automation infrastructure is worth building. The automation is a solution to a scale problem you haven't proven you have yet.
