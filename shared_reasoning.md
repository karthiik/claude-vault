# Shared Reasoning Log

This file captures the collaborative thinking process when multiple agents analyze an idea together.

## How This Works

When you invoke the counsel (e.g., "agents gather" or "counsel, evaluate this idea"), multiple subagents work in parallel on the same prompt. Each agent:

1. **Documents their reasoning** in real-time below
2. **Takes a perspective** (optimist vs skeptic, or assigned stance)
3. **Builds their case** with evidence and logic
4. **Notes key insights** and decision points

This creates a persistent record of how conclusions were reached, enabling:
- Transparency in AI-assisted thinking
- Learning from the reasoning process
- Building on previous analyses
