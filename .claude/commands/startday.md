# Start Day

Execute the morning startup routine to prepare for the day ahead.

## Steps

### 1. Gather Context

Read these files to understand the current state:

- **Today's daily note** (`Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — calendar, any pre-populated items
- **Yesterday's daily note** — action items, evening close, meeting notes
- **Day before yesterday** (if relevant) — for continuity on multi-day threads
- **AGENDA.md** — open threads, current focus areas, recent activity

### 2. Analyze Today's Calendar

For each meeting on today's calendar:
- What's the context? (Check recent notes for related discussions)
- Who will be there? (Any recent 1:1s or interactions with them?)
- What might I need to prepare?
- Are there open action items related to this meeting?

### 3. Surface Open Threads

From the last 2-3 days, identify:
- **Unfinished action items** — especially #p1 and career-aligned tasks
- **Waiting items** — things blocked on others
- **Recurring themes** — people, projects, or topics that keep coming up
- **Commitments made** — things you said you'd do

### 4. Connect the Dots

Look for patterns and connections:
- Which meetings today relate to yesterday's discussions?
- Are there people you're meeting who you have open items with?
- What project threads are active right now?
- Any deadlines approaching?

### 5. Generate Morning Brief

Present a concise morning brief with:

```markdown
## ☀️ Morning Brief — [Day, Date]

### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority
[Based on action items, calendar, and career goals — what's THE most important thing today?]

### 📅 Today's Meetings — Context & Prep
| Time | Meeting | Context | Prep Needed |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| HH:MM | [Meeting] | [What this relates to] | [Any prep?] |

### 🔥 Open Threads to Track
- [Thread 1] — from [date], status: [status]
- [Thread 2] — from [date], status: [status]

### 🔗 Connections Today
- [Person X] — you have open item: [item]
- [Meeting Y] connects to [Project Z] from yesterday

### ⚠️ Heads Up
- [Anything time-sensitive or noteworthy]
```

### 6. Set #1 Priority

Ask the user to confirm or adjust the suggested #1 priority, then update today's daily note.

### 7. Career Goal Check

Quick reminder of which career goals (G1/G2/G3) today's activities support:
- G1: External Visibility
- G2: Innovation Leadership
- G3: Role Transition

## Notes

- Keep the brief scannable — bullet points, tables
- Prioritize actionable insights over information dumps
- Flag anything that needs immediate attention
- If a meeting has no context from recent notes, note that (might need prep)
- Link to relevant notes using `[[wikilinks]]` so user can click through
