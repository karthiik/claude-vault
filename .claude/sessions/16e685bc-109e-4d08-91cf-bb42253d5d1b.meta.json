Your job is to prepare my daily executive briefing.\n\n## My Context\n\nI'm Karthik Ramadoss, SVP of Architecture & Delivery at Lockton. My 2026 theme is \"The year I become visible outside Lockton.\"\n\n### My 3 Strategic Goals\n- **G1: External Visibility** — 1 speaking gig + 2 articles published\n- **G2: Innovation Leadership** — Thesis defined + 2 pilots with impact\n- **G3: Role Transition** — Smooth handoff to incoming West CIO\n\n### Key Stakeholders to Flag\n- Byron Clymer (Global CIO, my boss)\n- Claude Yoder (Chief Digital Officer, innovation partner)\n- Glen Fellman (East CIO, peer)\n- Incoming West CIO (transition handoff)\n- Chennai/Trivandrum teams (GCC operations)\n- MIT CTO Program (learning priority)\n\n### Current Q1 Priorities\n1. Complete West CIO handoff\n2. Close FY budget (Apr 30 deadline)\n3. Sign Chennai contracts\n4. MIT CTO coursework progress\n5. Draft innovation thesis\n\n---\n\n## Your Task\n\nAnalyze my emails, calendar, and OneDrive notifications from the last 24 hours. Produce a briefing in the EXACT format below.\n\n**Important instructions:**\n- Be concise but complete — I'll paste this into my notes\n- Flag anything from key stakeholders immediately\n- Surface items that connect to G1, G2, or G3\n- Identify hidden opportunities (speaking invites, collaboration asks, visibility moments)\n- Warn me about risks (missed deadlines, political landmines, overcommitment)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format (copy exactly)\n\n### 📬 Email Intelligence\n\n**Requires Response (ranked by priority):**\n| # | From | Subject | Why It Matters | Suggested Action |\n|---|------|---------|----------------|------------------|\n| 1 | [name] | [subject] | [G1/G2/G3 connection or urgency] | [one-line action] |\n\n**FYI — Worth Knowing:**\n- [Bullet summary of important FYI emails]\n\n**Can Archive:**\n- [Count] emails are low-priority newsletters/notifications\n\n---\n\n### 📅 Today's Meetings\n\n| Time | Meeting | Prep Needed | Strategic Angle |\n|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|\n| [time] | [meeting name] | [what to review/know] | [G1/G2/G3 connection if any] |\n\n**Watch out:** [Any back-to-back issues, missing prep time, or conflicts]\n\n**Hidden opportunity:** [Any meeting that could serve visibility/innovation goals]\n\n---\n\n### 📂 OneDrive & SharePoint Alerts\n\n**Documents requiring attention:**\n- [File name] — shared by [person] — [why it matters]\n\n**Pending reviews/approvals:**\n- [Any documents awaiting your input]\n\n---\n\n### 🎯 Recommended #1 Priority\n\nBased on today's landscape, your single most important focus should be:\n\n> **[One clear priority statement]**\n\n*Why:* [Brief reasoning tied to goals or urgency]\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ Risks & Blockers\n\n- [Any deadline risks]\n- [Political/stakeholder concerns]\n- [Overcommitment warnings]\n\n---\n\n### 💡 Opportunities Spotted\n\n- **G1 (Visibility):** [Any speaking/writing/networking opportunities]\n- **G2 (Innovation):** [Any pilot ideas, Claude Yoder collaboration moments]\n- **G3 (Transition):** [Any handoff progress or concerns]\n\n---\n\n### 🔮 Heads Up (This Week)\n\n- [Important upcoming items from calendar/email threads]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Variant Prompts\n\n### Quick Morning Scan (Use \"Quick Response\" mode)\n\n```\nSummarize my unread emails from the last 24 hours. Rank top 5 by importance (1-5).\nFlag anything from: Byron Clymer, Claude Yoder, Glen Fellman, or Chennai/Trivandrum teams.\nList today's meetings with one-line prep notes each.\n```\n\n### Weekly Prep (Sunday evening)\n\n```\nYou are my Chief of Staff. Prepare my week-ahead briefing:\n\n1. **Calendar review:** List all meetings for the coming week, grouped by day. Flag any prep-heavy meetings or conflicts.\n\n2. **Email threads:** Summarize any email threads from last week that are still unresolved. Rank by importance.\n\n3. **Goal check-in:**\n   - G1 (Visibility): Any speaking/writing opportunities or deadlines this week?\n   - G2 (Innovation): Any pilot progress or Claude Yoder touchpoints?\n   - G3 (Transition): Any West CIO handoff items?\n\n4. **Recommend my \"theme\" for the week** — what should I focus on?\n\nFormat as a clean briefing I can paste into my weekly planning note.\n```\n\n### Meeting Prep (Before important meetings)\n\n```\nI have a meeting with [NAME] about [TOPIC] in [TIME].\n\nSearch my emails and OneDrive for:\n1. Recent correspondence with this person\n2. Documents related to this topic\n3. Any commitments I made in past meetings\n\nPrepare a 1-page brief:\n- Key context/history\n- What they likely want from me\n- What I should ask/propose\n- Potential landmines to avoid\n```\n\n### End of Day Wrap (Use \"Quick Response\" mode)\n\n```\nReview emails and Teams messages I sent today.\nList any commitments I made that need follow-up.\nSurface any threads where I'm waiting on someone else.\nFlag anything that should go into tomorrow's priorities.\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pro Tips\n\n### 1. Use Think Deeper for Complex Analysis\nThe morning briefing benefits from GPT-5.2's Thinking mode. It needs to:\n- Cross-reference multiple sources (email + calendar + files)\n- Reason about priority and strategic relevance\n- Generate structured, actionable output\n\n### 2. Reference Specific Time Windows\nInstead of vague requests, be specific:\n- ✓ \"emails from the last 24 hours\"\n- ✓ \"calendar for January 20-24\"\n- ✗ \"recent emails\" (ambiguous)\n\n### 3. Name Your Stakeholders Explicitly\nCopilot is better at filtering when you name names:\n- ✓ \"Flag anything from Byron Clymer or Claude Yoder\"\n- ✗ \"Flag important people\"\n\n### 4. Request Specific Output Formats\nTables and bullet lists paste cleanly into Obsidian:\n- ✓ \"Format as a markdown table\"\n- ✓ \"Use bullet points for FYI items\"\n\n### 5. Iterate Your Prompt\nSave versions that work well. Copilot's responses improve when you:\n- Add examples of good output\n- Clarify what \"priority\" means to you\n- Specify what to ignore (e.g., \"skip HR newsletters\")\n\n### 6. Combine with Things 3\nAfter your briefing, send time-sensitive action items to Things 3:\n- Deadlines → Things with due dates\n- Strategic items → Keep in daily note for context\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n\nUpdate the **Key Stakeholders** and **Q1 Priorities** sections quarterly as your focus shifts.\n\n### Q2 2026 Updates (suggested)\nOnce Q1 priorities resolve, update to:\n- West CIO handoff complete → Remove from priorities\n- Innovation thesis draft → Change to \"finalize thesis\"\n- Add: \"Submit speaking proposals\"\n- Add: \"Complete first article draft\"\n\n---\n\n## Related\n\n- [[Templates/Daily]] — Where briefing output goes\n- [[2026 Career Goals]] — The G1/G2/G3 framework\n- [[0_Career_Purpose_Index]] — Full career context\n\n---\n\n## Sources & Further Reading\n\n- [What's New with GPT-5 in Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/do-more-with-ai/general-ai/whats-new-with-gpt-5-in-copilot) — Microsoft's GPT-5 features\n- [GPT-5.2 in Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/12/11/available-today-gpt-5-2-in-microsoft-365-copilot/) — Thinking mode details\n- [Copilot Scheduled Prompts](https://tminus365.com/this-copilot-trick-turns-outlook-into-your-executive-assistant/) — Automation setup\n- [Microsoft Copilot Prompts Gallery](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/copilot-prompts) — Official prompt library\n- [Microsoft 365 Copilot Power User Tips](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftmechanicsblog/microsoft-365-copilot-power-user-tips/4404994) — Advanced techniques\n"
