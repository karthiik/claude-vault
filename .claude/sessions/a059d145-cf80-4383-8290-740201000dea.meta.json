With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.

Your peace matters\n3. **Decide and Move** — Be confident in the decisions you make.

Processing thoughts on paper keeps you grounded and present\n5. **Practice Gratitude** — Remember all that you have in your life.

Intuition is your compass — listen to what feels right rather than overthinking or forcing outcomes\n2. **Choose You First** — Do what feels right to you, not what makes someone else happy. Your peace matters\n3. **Decide and Move** — Be confident in the decisions you make. Once you've decided, commit — don't rethink or second-guess\n4. **Journal for Clarity** — Practice mindfulness by writing regularly. Processing thoughts on paper keeps you grounded and present\n5. **Practice Gratitude** — Remember all that you have in your life. Gratitude shifts perspective from scarcity to abundance\n6. **Break the Pattern** — You've let health slip before — eating, activity, strength. Name it, remember it, don't repeat it this year\n\n---\n\n## Review Cadence\n\n| Frequency | Activity |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Weekly** | Quick scan — anything urgent? Any area neglected? |\n| **Monthly** | Check each area — where's the imbalance? |\n| **Quarterly** | Deep review — adjust goals and intentions |\n| **Annually** | Life audit — new Word of the Year, reset intentions |\n\n---\n\n## How Areas Connect\n\n**Areas ↔ Projects:**\n- **Areas** = ongoing (no end date)\n- **Projects** = time-bound efforts with clear outcomes\n\n| Project | Serves Area(s) |\n|---------|----------------|\n| MIT CTO Program | Career & Purpose, Education & Learning |\n| 2026 GAS Summit | Career & Purpose |\n| London Trip | Joy, Creativity & Play, Relationships & Social Life |\n| India/Dubai Trip | Joy, Creativity & Play, Relationships & Social Life |\n| EJ College Transition | Relationships & Social Life |\n\n**Areas ↔ Each Other:**\n- Health → enables → Career performance\n- Career → provides → Financial security\n- Finances → enables → Home (environment)\n- Home → supports → Health recovery\n- Relationships → fuel → Joy\n- Learning → accelerates → Career growth\n- Contribution → deepens → Relationships\n\n---\n\n## Open Tasks\n\n- [x] Build out Health – Mind, Body & Spirit index #area/health #p2\n- [x] Build out Relationships & Social Life index #area/relationships #p2\n- [x] Build out Finances & Security index #area/finance #p3\n- [x] Build out Education & Learning index #area/learning #p3\n- [x] Build out Joy, Creativity & Play index #area/recreation #p3\n- [x] Build out Home & Environment index #area/environment #p3\n- [x] Build out Contribution & Legacy index #area/contribution #p3\n",
