      "newContent": "# Innovation Thesis\n\n**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)\n**Created:** 2026-01-25\n**Status:** In Progress\n**Supports:** [[2026 Career Goals|G1: External Visibility]], [[2026 Career Goals|G2: Innovation Leadership]]\n\n---\n\n## The One-Liner\n\n> **\"AI in insurance isn't a technology project — it's a workforce transformation. Our digital investments create the foundation; now we scale by enabling every person to use it.\"**\n\n---\n\n## The Core Belief\n\nAI won't transform insurance through pilots alone. The experiments and POCs are essential — they prove what works. But transformation requires three things most companies underinvest in:\n\n1. **Infrastructure** that enables scale (beyond the sandbox)\n2. **Workforce enablement** so every person benefits (not just pilot teams)\n3. **Experimentation discipline** that ties to business outcomes\n\n---\n\n## Pillar 1: From Pilots to Production (The Messy Middle)\n\n### The Pattern\nPOCs work beautifully in sandboxed environments. Then they hit the \"messy middle\" — the gap between demo and enterprise reality:\n\n| Demo Reality | Enterprise Reality |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Clean data | Technical debt, legacy systems |\n| Single use case | End-to-end workflow integration |\n| No governance | Auditability, security, compliance |\n| \"It works!\" | Reversible vs. irreversible actions |\n\n### What IT Needs to Build\n- **Data governance** — clean, accessible, compliant data\n- **Secure middleware** — integration layer between AI and systems of record\n- **Agent tracing** — chain-of-reasoning logging, auditability\n- **Action classification** — reversible vs. irreversible action frameworks\n- **Human-in-the-loop patterns** — for irreversible actions\n\n### What This Enables\nThe pilots we're running today become the foundation for enterprise-wide deployment — not islands of innovation that never scale.\n\n---\n\n## Pillar 2: Workforce Enablement (People Before Agents)\n\n### The Insight\nAI is a capability you embed into *people*, not just processes. Every person needs to develop AI intuition before they can trust agentic workflows.\n\n### The Progression\n```\nLevel 1: Summarize (emails, documents, meetings)\n    ↓\nLevel 2: Automate (action items, routine tasks)\n    ↓\nLevel 3: Create (presentations, reports, drafts)\n    ↓\nLevel 4: Trust (agentic workflows with human oversight)\n```\n\n### Jagged Intelligence\nAI is brilliant at some things and fails at basics (the \"strawberry\" problem). You can't trust it blindly — you need experience to know where the edges are. This intuition only comes from personal use.\n\n### The Opportunity\nWhen the workforce is enabled, AI scales naturally. Every person becomes an AI-augmented worker, not just the pilot teams.\n\n---\n\n## Pillar 3: Innovation Discipline (Outcomes Over Glamour)\n\n### The Mythology Problem\n\"Innovation\" gets treated as the holy grail — the chosen few, the shiny widgets. This creates barriers and disconnects innovation from business reality.\n\n### The Truth\nInnovation is just *challenging the status quo*. It comes in three forms:\n- **Process innovation** — better ways of working\n- **Business innovation** — new models, markets, offerings\n- **Tech innovation** — new tools and capabilities\n\n### The Discipline\nEvery experiment must connect to a business outcome:\n\n| Outcome Type | Question |\n|--------------|----------|\n| **Optimization** | Does this make us faster/cheaper/better? |\n| **Client retention** | Does this keep clients loyal? |\n| **Client growth** | Does this win new business? |\n\n### The Method\n- **Define success criteria** before you start\n- **Quick, cheap, low-risk** experiments\n- **Measure** ruthlessly\n- **Kill** what doesn't work\n- **Scale** what does\n- **Compound** small wins over time\n\n---\n\n## Future Research: Regional & Market Context\n\n### US Context (Current Focus)\n- Broker-driven, human-touch sales economy\n- Lower historical digital investment\n- **Implication:** Fundamentals first (Pillars 1-3) before API orchestration\n\n### Regional Analysis Needed\n\n| Region | Context | Digital Readiness | Research Status |\n|--------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| **Americas (US)** | Broker-driven, human-touch | Foundational work needed | Current focus |\n| **Europe (Lloyd's)** | Single marketplace, regulatory push | Leading edge | To study |\n| **MENA / APAC** | Mixed by market | TBD | To analyze |\n\n### The API Economy (Watch This Space)\nDocument-centric business is inefficient. The future is API-driven:\n- Carriers exposing APIs\n- Digital marketplaces (Lloyd's model)\n- Agent-to-agent orchestration\n\n**Timeline:** 3-5 years out. Readiness varies by region. Lloyd's is the leading edge to study.\n\n---\n\n## How This Shapes the Innovation Sprint\n\nThis thesis informs the [[0_Innovation_Sprint_Index|Innovation Sprint]] approach:\n\n1. **Sprint experiments** tie to the three outcomes (optimize, retain, grow)\n2. **Success criteria defined upfront** — pass/fail is clear\n3. **Infrastructure readiness** is a parallel workstream\n4. **Workforce enablement** is measured (not just tech deployment)\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- [ ] Who is doing this well? Find 2-3 reference companies/case studies\n- [ ] Lloyd's digital marketplace — research current state and roadmap\n- [ ] Regional analysis — what matters in Europe vs. APAC vs. MENA?\n- [ ] How do we measure workforce AI enablement? (Metrics needed)\n\n---\n\n## Version History\n\n| Date | Version | Changes |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| 2026-01-25 | 0.1 | Initial draft from coaching session with Claudian |\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- [ ] Review with 2 advisors (March milestone)\n- [ ] Test with external audience (May milestone)\n- [ ] Finalize thesis (Q2)\n"

Everything else is secondary.*\n\n**→ [[2026 Career Goals]]** — Full cascade: goals, quarterly intentions, monthly milestones\n\n### Success Criteria (Dec 2026)\n\n- [ ] 1+ external speaking engagement (conference, podcast, or panel) #area/career #p1\n- [ ] 2+ published articles beyond LinkedIn #area/career #p2\n- [ ] Innovation thesis articulated and tested with external audiences #area/career #p2\n- [ ] At least 1 external sponsor/advocate relationship developed #area/career #p2\n\n### Why This Theme?\n\nInternal credibility is established (GAS Summit, AI expert, GCC expansion). The gap to CTO and thought leadership is **external visibility**. 2026 is the year to close that gap.\n\n---\n\n## Current Role\n\n> [!Profile]\n> Hello! With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.
