With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.

With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.

With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.

With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.

The teaching/publishing extends impact beyond company walls. Both feed each other.\n\n---\n\n## 2026 Theme\n\n> **\"The year I become visible outside Lockton.\"**\n\n*One theme to guide decisions. Everything else is secondary.*\n\n### Success Criteria (Dec 2026)\n\n- [ ] 1+ external speaking engagement (conference, podcast, or panel) #area/career #p1\n- [ ] 2+ published articles beyond LinkedIn #area/career #p2\n- [ ] Innovation thesis articulated and tested with external audiences #area/career #p2\n- [ ] At least 1 external sponsor/advocate relationship developed #area/career #p2\n\n### Why This Theme?\n\nInternal credibility is established (GAS Summit, AI expert, GCC expansion). The gap to CTO and thought leadership is **external visibility**. 2026 is the year to close that gap.\n\n---\n\n## Current Role\n\n> [!Profile]\n> Hello! With over 20 years immersed in the ever-evolving world of IT, all within the dynamic insurance industry, I've navigated a diverse array of roles that have shaped my broad expertise as a technologist. From modern agile application development to devops practices, data engineering, and cloud migrations, my journey has been about turning complex challenges into seamless solutions.\n>\n> I've been privileged to work with innovative business teams, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, RPA, and GenAI to redefine what's possible in our field. My experience spans deploying major platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, Oracle Finance Cloud, and Microsoft's data analytics platforms, always with an eye toward transformative results.\n>\n> Beyond the technology, my true passion lies in cultivating a growth mindset among my teams. I've built and led hybrid and global agile delivery teams, focusing on efficient processes and the kind of continuous learning that leads to success. For me, it's all about empowering people—helping them grow, learn, and achieve more than they thought possible.\n>\n> Let's connect and explore how we can drive the future of insurance technology together!\n>\n> My hobbies include hiking around the world, biking and stretching my photography skills.\n\n### Scope (transitioning)\n\n| Dimension      | Current                 | After Transition                                |\n| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| Direct reports | 8                       | 5                                               |\n| Total org      | ~65                     | Reduced                                         |\n| Budget         | ~$20M                   | TBD                                             |\n| Focus          | Architecture + Delivery | **Global Enterprise Architecture + Innovation** |\n\n*Operational delivery responsibilities transitioning to incoming West CIO.*\n\n### Key Stakeholders\n\n| Name         | Role                  | Relationship               |\n| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Byron Clymer | *Global CIO*          | Reports to                 |\n| Glen Fellman | East CIO              | Peer                       |\n| *[TBD]*      | West CIO (incoming)   | Peer — operational handoff |\n| Claude Yoder | Chief Digital Officer | Stakeholder                |\n\n### Current Focus (Q1 2026)\n\n| Priority | Deadline | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| Operational handoff to new West CIO | Ongoing | Smooth transition |\n| FY budget wrap-up | Apr 30 | Fiscal year close |\n| Chennai team contracts | Q1 | New contract signing |\n| MIT CTO coursework | Ongoing | Active development |\n| Claude Yoder relationship | Ongoing | Partner on AI implementations |\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\n### Lockton (2019–present) — 6+ years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2023–present | SVP, Architecture & App Delivery | Global Architecture Summit, GenAI, Enterprise Architecture |\n| 2021–2023 | VP, App Dev & Delivery | Cloud adoption, Salesforce, Oracle ERP, Digital Transformation |\n| 2019–2021 | AVP, Application Delivery | AWS, Cloud-Native Architecture, Software Development |\n\n### AF-Group (2012–2019) — 7 years\n\n| Years | Role | Key Focus |\n|-------|------|-----------|\n| 2018–2019 | Manager, Digital Experience & R&D | Omni-channel CX, Office 365, Blockchain, RPA prototyping |\n| 2016–2018 | Manager, Infrastructure Engineering | Infrastructure strategy, Hadoop, telephony consolidation |\n| 2015–2016 | Supervisor, Database & Middleware | Platform administration, risk management |\n| 2012–2014 | Database Administrator Lead | Oracle licensing, performance optimization, Hadoop |\n\n### Earlier Career (2003–2012)\n\n| Years     | Role                   | Company               |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 2003–2012 | Database Administrator | The ASU Group         |\n| 2003      | Database Administrator | Computech Corporation |\n\n### The Arc\n\n**DBA → Infrastructure → Digital/Innovation → Architecture & Delivery → (next: CTO)**\n\n20+ years in insurance tech.
