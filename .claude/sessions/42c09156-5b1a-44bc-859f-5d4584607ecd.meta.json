      "newContent": "# icalBuddy + Templater Setup\n\nOne-time configuration to pull your calendar into daily notes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Create the Script\n\nCreate a file at `~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh`:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/obsidian-scripts\n```\n\nThen create the file with this content:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Calendar events for Obsidian daily notes\n\n/opt/homebrew/bin/icalBuddy \\\n  -npn \\\n  -nc \\\n  -ps \"/: /\" \\\n  -iep \"datetime,title\" \\\n  -po \"datetime,title\" \\\n  -tf \"%H:%M\" \\\n  -df \"\" \\\n  -ec \"Birthdays,US Holidays,United States holidays,Kansas City Chiefs,PGA,Dallas Cowboys\" \\\n  eventsToday\n```\n\nMake it executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x ~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Test the Script\n\nRun in Terminal:\n\n```bash\n~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh\n```\n\nYou should see today's events formatted like:\n\n```\n08:30: Team standup\n10:00: Architecture review\n14:00: 1:1 with Jamie\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Configure Templater\n\n1. Open Obsidian → **Settings** → **Templater**\n2. Scroll to **User System Command Functions**\n3. Click **Add New User Function**\n4. Set:\n   - **Function name:** `calendar`\n   - **System command:** `~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh`\n5. **Enable** \"Shell scripts in Templates folder\" if prompted\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Grant Permissions (First Run)\n\nThe first time Templater runs the script, macOS may ask for calendar permissions.\n\nIf it doesn't work:\n1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars**\n2. Ensure **Obsidian** has access\n3. You may also need to grant access to **Terminal** or the shell\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Test in Obsidian\n\nCreate a test note with:\n\n```\n<% tp.user.calendar() %>\n```\n\nSwitch to Preview mode — your calendar should appear.\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n\n### Exclude More Calendars\n\nEdit the script and add calendar names to the `-ec` flag:\n\n```bash\n-ec \"Birthdays,US Holidays,Calendar Name Here\"\n```\n\n### Include Only Specific Calendars\n\nReplace `-ec` with `-ic` (include calendars):\n\n```bash\n-ic \"Work,Karthiks Personal,Ramadoss, Karthik\"\n```\n\n### Show Location\n\nAdd `location` to the fields:\n\n```bash\n-iep \"datetime,title,location\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Your Calendars\n\nBased on your setup, here are your calendars:\n\n| Calendar | Type | Likely Use |\n|----------|------|------------|\n| Ramadoss, Karthik | Exchange | Work (Outlook) |\n| Work | CalDAV | Work |\n| Karthiks Personal | CalDAV | Personal |\n| Vinay | CalDAV | Vinay's schedule |\n| Household | CalDAV | Shared household |\n| ❤️‍🔥🏋️Habits | CalDAV | Habit reminders |\n\n**Excluded by default:** Birthdays, US Holidays, Sports (Chiefs, PGA, Cowboys)\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"Calendar not configured\" in daily note:**\n- Templater user function not set up → Follow Step 3\n\n**Empty calendar:**\n- No events today, or permissions issue → Check System Settings\n\n**Permission denied:**\n- Run `chmod +x ~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh`\n\n**icalBuddy not found:**\n- Reinstall: `brew install ical-buddy`\n\n---\n\n*Delete this file after setup is complete.*\n"

This repository is a personal operating system—a single source of truth for projects, knowledge, and life.\n\n## Agenda\n\n`AGENDA.md` is a snapshot of our recent activity: what we've been working on, upcoming plans, important moments and nuances. It's the short-term context of our interaction — everything relevant for the current session.\n\nLong-term information lives in projects, notes, and areas.

      "newContent": "# Jamie Shaw — 2025 Recap & 2026 Vision\n\n---\n\n## 2025: The Word of the Year\n\n> **Redemption**\n\n*In 2025, I was redeemed not by erasing the accident, but by processing it. I asked the Universe for redemption and happiness in January; by December, I saw myself as \"normal again — changed but grounded\".*\n\n---\n\n## Year Summary & Key Memories\n\n2025 was the year I reintegrated into my own life. I will likely remember:\n\n- **The WIL National Leadership Event** — The moment my \"recovery story\" became a source of public empowerment\n- **The Accident Anniversary** — Transforming a day of trauma into a \"backyard party\" with baton trophies, signaling a shift from memorialization to celebration\n- **The Return to the Kitchen** — Reclaiming the joy of cooking and shared meals, which signaled that I no longer felt \"fight or flight\"\n- **A Family Dog** — Welcoming Skai to the family; giving and receiving so much love\n\n---\n\n## Themes & Patterns\n\nAcross all areas of life, several core themes emerged consistently throughout the year:\n\n| Theme | Insight |\n|-------|---------|\n| **Mind-Body-Spirit Connection** | Mental anxiety was deeply intertwined with physical symptoms like neck tightness and blood pressure. Progress in one area often depended on attention to another. |\n| **Intentional Pacing** | Moved from \"slower pace\" in January to \"quiet momentum\" in July. Consistently prioritized \"alignment over speed\". |\n| **Vulnerability as Leadership** | Sharing my recovery story publicly marked a major turning point, shifting my identity from victim to leader of \"human experience\". |\n| **Environment as Sanctuary** | Home was a consistent \"sanctuary\" and \"safe space\" for healing. Upgrading HVAC directly supported my voice. |\n| **Reclaiming Rhythms** | Joy was found in the return of \"old days\" feelings — NICA races, family trips, and concerts. |\n\n---\n\n## What to Leave in 2025\n\nTo move into 2026 fully, these narratives and habits have served their purpose and can now be retired:\n\n- ❌ The \"Demoted\" label at work\n- ❌ Fear that others see me as \"disabled\" after the accident\n- ❌ Shrinking / Fear of Rejection\n- ❌ Victimhood and identity defined solely by trauma\n- ❌ Control & Perfectionism — especially regarding voice and relationship outcomes\n\n---\n\n## Lessons to Carry Forward into 2026\n\nThese are the insights gained from both the \"flowing\" and \"stuck\" moments of 2025:\n\n1. **Intuition is the Compass** — Trust my gut and \"listen for what truly fits\" rather than forcing outcomes\n2. **Boundaries Protect Peace** — Maintaining distance from toxic behaviors is essential for nervous system regulation\n3. **Presence Over Perfection** — Choosing to be present in my body, even with its limitations, allows me to welcome happiness\n4. **The Power of Ritual** — Rituals (old and new) help process trauma and celebrate milestones\n\n---\n\n## Monthly Journey\n\n### January — Intentional Re-entry\n\n*January was intentional re-entry. I balanced medical realities with hope, accepted a slower pace, and let reconnection happen organically.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 1/3: Logan's birthday at Extra Virgin (first time together since the accident)\n- 1/14: First day back in the office — emotional reunions\n- 1/27–1/31: Karthik in KC; exchanged Christmas gifts and celebrated his birthday\n\n**Health — Mind, Body & Spirit:**\n- **Mind:** Meditation daily; journaled about boundaries and self-worth\n- **Body:** Treatments for voice, scar, neck; started new supplements\n- **Spirit:** Asked the Universe for redemption and happiness\n\n---\n\n### February — Bridge Between Recovery and What's Next\n\n*February was an intentional bridge. I leaned on daily meditation and bodywork, accepted a slower cadence at work, and protected my peace at home.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- Two snowstorms; EJ slid off Crooked Rd (safe but car needed bumper)\n\n**Health — Mind, Body & Spirit:**\n- **Mind:** Meditated daily; journaled about feeling disconnected\n- **Body:** Prioritized healing voice, neck tension, scar adhesions\n- **Spirit:** Used astrology as reflective frame for endings and new beginnings\n\n---\n\n### March — Recalibration\n\n*March was a recalibration. Burnout surfaced alongside a desire for joy. Skai's adoption steadied me and gave me purpose.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 3/15: Meredith and EJ adopted Skai\n- 3/27: Royals home opener\n\n**Health — Mind, Body & Spirit:**\n- **Mind:** Journaled about burnout and need for reset\n- **Body:** Replanned routines for exercise and supplements\n- **Spirit:** Eclipse season became a lens for acceptance and letting go\n\n---\n\n### April — Action and Preparation\n\n*April was action and preparation. I set clear intentions, traveled for the first time since Maui, and lined up medical steps for my voice.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 4/10: Car accident on the way to therapy\n- 4/15: Moveworks conference in San Jose — first flight since Maui\n- 4/22: EJ's birthday dinner\n- 4/28: Surgery scheduled for 5/8\n\n---\n\n### May — Turning the Page\n\n*May felt like turning the page. Surgery closed a long chapter. Confidence returned in noticeable ways.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 5/8: Surgery — scar adhesion removed; vocal cord bulked\n- 5/30–6/1: Branson Big Cedar Lodge family trip with Skai\n\n**Health — Mind, Body & Spirit:**\n- **Mind:** Declared this my \"comeback\" — letting go of needing voice to be perfect\n- **Body:** Surgery felt like closure; began neurofeedback\n- **Spirit:** New Moon in Gemini intentions: feeling normal, self-love, peace\n\n---\n\n### June — Feeling Lighter\n\n*June felt lighter. Visibility at work returned, travel boosted confidence, and my daily \"serves my energy\" practice helped me leave stress behind.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 6/4: State of the Companies — official re-entry and visibility\n- 6/24–6/26: Atlanta Microsoft Digital Workspace Workshop\n- 6/27–6/29: Chattanooga trip\n\n---\n\n### July — Quiet Momentum\n\n*July was quiet momentum that culminated in the WIL event. Speaking publicly about my recovery marked a turning point — I felt seen, proud, and ready.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 7/24: Mumford & Sons with Trevor\n- 7/26: The Lumineers with EJ\n- 7/29: **WIL National Leadership Event** — fireside chat; shared recovery story publicly for first time\n\n---\n\n### August — Celebration\n\n*August was a celebration. I marked milestones, welcomed people back into my space, and found magic in reconnection. Life was rhyming — and I was ready to sing along.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 8/11–8/15: Bentonville trip (Karthik surprised us)\n- 8/12: Accident anniversary\n- 8/14: My birthday\n- 8/16: **Backyard party** — \"Bring My Batons to the Backyard\"\n- 8/18–8/20: Digital Insurance Connect — facilitated Employee Experience roundtable\n- 8/21: The Avett Brothers with EJ\n- 8/28: Gregory Alan Isakov with Karthik\n\n---\n\n### September — Reconnection and Resolve\n\n*September blended reconnection and resolve. Music moved me, I celebrated EJ's race, and upgraded my environment to support my voice.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 9/2: Upgraded HVAC — vital for voice\n- 9/6–9/7: NICA race — EJ finished 7th; Skai became team mascot\n- 9/11–9/15: Bourbon & Beyond festival\n- 9/16–9/18: Workday Rising conference\n\n---\n\n### October — Reset\n\n*October was a reset. I let go of an old identity, clarified my goals, and did meaningful work aligned with purpose.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 10/6–10/8: K&J AI presentation to HR in Chicago\n- 10/28–10/31: Warsaw, MO reset trip with Skai; visited dad's grave\n\n---\n\n### November — Gratitude Embodied\n\n*November felt like gratitude embodied. I tracked how far I've come, enjoyed relaxed time with Karthik, and reclaimed joy at home — especially cooking.*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 11/7–11/9: EJ Broadcasting State Competition\n- 11/14–11/16: Deloitte Workday Phase 0 planning\n- 11/18–11/20: Fort Smith, AR trip\n- 11/27–11/30: Three Thanksgiving meals (EJ, Logan, and Karthik)\n\n---\n\n### December — Gratitude and Closure\n\n*December was gratitude and closure. I felt normal again — changed, but grounded. What a way to end the year — \"redemption\".*\n\n**Key Events:**\n- 12/1–12/5: Karthik in KC\n- 12/25: Christmas — Karthik joined\n- 12/26–12/28: Staycation\n\n**Health — Mind, Body & Spirit:**\n- **Mind:** Feel more normal, more confident, more at peace\n- **Body:** Holiday cooking returned without rigid restriction — signs of healing\n- **Spirit:** Embraced authenticity, present moment, and the Four Agreements\n\n---\n\n## 2026: The Word of the Year\n\n> **Abundance**\n\n*We rise together, each in our own way.*\n\n---\n\n**Nav:** [[2026 Vision and Intentions - Karthik|Karthik's Vision]] · [[0_Areas_Index|Areas]]\n"
