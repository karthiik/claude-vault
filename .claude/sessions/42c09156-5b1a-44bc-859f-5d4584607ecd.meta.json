      "newContent": "# icalBuddy + Templater Setup\n\nOne-time configuration to pull your calendar into daily notes.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Create the Script\n\nCreate a file at `~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh`:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/obsidian-scripts\n```\n\nThen create the file with this content:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# Calendar events for Obsidian daily notes\n\n/opt/homebrew/bin/icalBuddy \\\n  -npn \\\n  -nc \\\n  -ps \"/: /\" \\\n  -iep \"datetime,title\" \\\n  -po \"datetime,title\" \\\n  -tf \"%H:%M\" \\\n  -df \"\" \\\n  -ec \"Birthdays,US Holidays,United States holidays,Kansas City Chiefs,PGA,Dallas Cowboys\" \\\n  eventsToday\n```\n\nMake it executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x ~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Test the Script\n\nRun in Terminal:\n\n```bash\n~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh\n```\n\nYou should see today's events formatted like:\n\n```\n08:30: Team standup\n10:00: Architecture review\n14:00: 1:1 with Jamie\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Configure Templater\n\n1. Open Obsidian → **Settings** → **Templater**\n2. Scroll to **User System Command Functions**\n3. Click **Add New User Function**\n4. Set:\n   - **Function name:** `calendar`\n   - **System command:** `~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh`\n5. **Enable** \"Shell scripts in Templates folder\" if prompted\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Grant Permissions (First Run)\n\nThe first time Templater runs the script, macOS may ask for calendar permissions.\n\nIf it doesn't work:\n1. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Calendars**\n2. Ensure **Obsidian** has access\n3. You may also need to grant access to **Terminal** or the shell\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Test in Obsidian\n\nCreate a test note with:\n\n```\n<% tp.user.calendar() %>\n```\n\nSwitch to Preview mode — your calendar should appear.\n\n---\n\n## Customization\n\n### Exclude More Calendars\n\nEdit the script and add calendar names to the `-ec` flag:\n\n```bash\n-ec \"Birthdays,US Holidays,Calendar Name Here\"\n```\n\n### Include Only Specific Calendars\n\nReplace `-ec` with `-ic` (include calendars):\n\n```bash\n-ic \"Work,Karthiks Personal,Ramadoss, Karthik\"\n```\n\n### Show Location\n\nAdd `location` to the fields:\n\n```bash\n-iep \"datetime,title,location\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Your Calendars\n\nBased on your setup, here are your calendars:\n\n| Calendar | Type | Likely Use |\n|----------|------|------------|\n| Ramadoss, Karthik | Exchange | Work (Outlook) |\n| Work | CalDAV | Work |\n| Karthiks Personal | CalDAV | Personal |\n| Vinay | CalDAV | Vinay's schedule |\n| Household | CalDAV | Shared household |\n| ❤️‍🔥🏋️Habits | CalDAV | Habit reminders |\n\n**Excluded by default:** Birthdays, US Holidays, Sports (Chiefs, PGA, Cowboys)\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**\"Calendar not configured\" in daily note:**\n- Templater user function not set up → Follow Step 3\n\n**Empty calendar:**\n- No events today, or permissions issue → Check System Settings\n\n**Permission denied:**\n- Run `chmod +x ~/.config/obsidian-scripts/calendar.sh`\n\n**icalBuddy not found:**\n- Reinstall: `brew install ical-buddy`\n\n---\n\n*Delete this file after setup is complete.*\n"

This repository is a personal operating system—a single source of truth for projects, knowledge, and life.\n\n## Agenda\n\n`AGENDA.md` is a snapshot of our recent activity: what we've been working on, upcoming plans, important moments and nuances. It's the short-term context of our interaction — everything relevant for the current session.\n\nLong-term information lives in projects, notes, and areas. But if something is currently active, we add a link to it in Agenda.\n\n**At the start of every session:**\nRead `AGENDA.md` — context, where we left off, open threads.\n\n**At the end of work or during sync:** update `AGENDA.md` — keep it current, compact, don't let it grow infinitely.\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\nEverything lives in markdown.
