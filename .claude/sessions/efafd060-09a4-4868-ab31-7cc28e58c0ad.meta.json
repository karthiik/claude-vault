Our 3rd Global Architecture Summit just wrapped (Jan 12-14, 2026).\n\nHere's what happened.\n\nDay 1: Preparation & The Messy Middle\n\nI opened the summit with a word: Preparation.\n\nAI is everywhere right now. Every vendor pitch, every conference keynote, every board meeting. And the pressure to move fast is real. But I wanted to start the summit by talking about something less exciting: the work underneath.\n\nHere's what I mean by the \"Messy Middle\": it's the infrastructure layer between brilliant AI ideas and production-ready solutions. Cloud migration still in progress. DevSecOps pipelines that need hardening. Data governance that's inconsistent across regions. These aren't failures. They are the real areas of work IT teams across the globe have in our hands.\n\nThe teams building AI innovations are doing exactly what we need them to do. They're proving what's possible, finding the edges, and showing us where the foundation cracks under pressure. That's valuable insight. Our job in IT is to strengthen that foundation fast enough to keep up with them.\n\nIt's a partnership. Innovation teams push us to modernize faster. Our modernization helps them ship faster. Neither side wins alone. We win, together!\n\nByron Clymer followed with a keynote that gave our technical audience something they don't always get: a deep look at how Lockton business works across the globe. He walked us through the insurance brokerage business from parametric insurance to emerging innovations happening across the industry. For technologists who spend their days in code and infrastructure, understanding the brokerage model we're building for matters. \n\nIt gave every technical session that followed a business foundation & context to build on.\n\nThe full Day 1 lineup:\n\n• **Summit Opening & Welcome** (Karthik Ramadoss) - Introduced the \"Messy Middle\" theme, what we do about it in light of AI and the word of the summit: **Preparation**\n• **Opening Keynote** (Byron Clymer) - Walked us through the insurance brokerage business and how Lockton makes money\n• **Global Enterprise Architecture Panel** (David George, James Solko, Karthik Ramadoss, Shanna Sommers) - Tackled the big questions facing architecture teams across regions\n• TechTalk: Risk Management & Compliance (Elizabeth Thomas, David Collins) - How we're thinking about security and compliance in an AI-first world\n• Podcast: GitReal - No Merge Conflict, Just Real Talk (Megan Matile & GitReal Team) - Live recording covering real engineering culture topics\n• Breakout: Security Track (Joey Lamb, Raoul Hira) - Hands-on security practices and threat awareness\n• Breakout: Mulesoft Technical Expert (Kumar Vuddaraju) - API integration patterns and Mulesoft best practices\n• Breakout: Databricks - Productionalizing AI (Daniel Tomes, Field CTO) - Moving AI from experiments to production workloads\n• Day 1 Closing Remarks (James Solko) - Recap and setup for Day 2\n\nWe ran the breakouts Olympics-style: three teams (Canada, Norway, USA) rotating through all three tracks. Kept the energy competitive.\n\nDinner was at Boulevard Brewing. Shuffleboard happened. Ideas kept flowing.\n\nDay 2: Getting Specific\n\nThe full Day 2 lineup:\n\n• Day 2 Welcome (Karthik Ramadoss) - Focused on AI security and hands-on tracks\n• Keynote: AI Security (Felix Simmons) - Real attack vectors and security considerations as AI scales across the enterprise\n• Architecture of Olympics (Jill Hodge) - Connected Olympic training principles to how we approach architecture discipline\n• TechTalk: Affinity and Beyond - Mission 0001 (Julie Morris) - Roadmap update on where Affinity is headed next\n• TechTalk: M365 PowerPlatform (Travis Chambers) - What's actually possible with Power Platform today\n• Breakout: AI Agents Track (Larry Lane, Shane Strong) - Building and deploying autonomous AI agents\n• Breakout: Perficient - Dynamic Agent Frameworks (Nico Frantzen) - Patterns for flexible, adaptable agent architectures\n• Breakout: Data & Fabric Track (Rajesh Paul, James Solko) - Data architecture foundations that enable AI at scale\n• Day 2 Closing Remarks (Karthik Ramadoss) - Wrapped up and setup for Hackathon Day\n\nEvening: KC BBQ at Joe's. Trivia competition. Someone's team name was \"Hallucinating LLMs\" which felt appropriate.\n\nDay 3: Hackathon\n\nTeams built working AI prototypes for real Lockton problems. Not slide decks. Working code. Some of the solutions are already in conversations about production.\n\nOur Focus for 2026\n\n• Retire technical debt faster\n• Finish cloud migration\n• Double down on DevSecOps\n• Get hands-on with AI tools (what I'm calling \"AI Gym\" time)\n\nThe Numbers\n\n2024 (Atlanta): 30 attendees\n2025 (Dallas): 55 attendees\n2026 (Kansas City): 60+ attendees\n\nWhat's Next\n\nQuarterly virtual summits. Monthly AC4E lunch-and-learns. We're not slowing down.\n\nThanks to everyone who showed up, presented, asked hard questions, and stayed late arguing about architecture.\n\nKeynotes: Byron Clymer (Lockton CIO), Felix Simmons\n\nSponsors: [Add names]\n\nEvents team: [Add names]\n\n#EnterpriseArchitecture #Lockton #Technology\n\n---\n\n## AI Slop Corrections Made\n\n| Original | Revised | Reason |\n|----------|---------|--------|\n| \"Deep dive into the insurance brokerage business\" | \"Walked us through the insurance brokerage business\" | \"Deep dive\" is Tier 1 AI slop |\n| \"It also set the stage for the next two days\" | \"It gave every technical session that followed a business foundation to build on\" | \"Set the stage\" is puffery phrase |\n| \"invaluable context\" | \"matters\" | Generic AI phrasing |\n| \"The momentum is real.\" | Cut | AI enthusiasm; numbers speak for themselves |\n| \"The creativity was the best part.\" | \"Some of the solutions are already in conversations about production.\" | Vague and generic |\n| \"Set the tone for a day focused on\" | \"Focused on\" | Unnecessary filler |\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- Remember to add sponsor names before posting\n- Add events team names\n- Consider adding a group photo at the top\n- Tag speakers in LinkedIn when posting\n\n---\n\n## Related Files\n\n- [[AI-Slop-Avoidance-Guide]] - Reference for avoiding AI-sounding language\n- [[2026 GAS Summit Reflection]] - Personal reflections from the summit\n- [[Agenda GAS 2026 Mon.Tues]] - Full agenda document\n",

Our 3rd Global Architecture Summit just wrapped (Jan 12-14, 2026).\n\nHere's what happened.\n\n🚀 Day 1: Preparation - The Messy Middle\n\nI opened the summit with a word: Preparation.\n\nAI is everywhere right now. Every vendor pitch, every conference keynote, every board meeting. And the pressure to move fast is real. But I wanted to start the summit by talking about something less exciting: the work underneath.\n\nHere's what I mean by the \"*Messy Middle*\": it's the infrastructure layer between brilliant AI ideas and production-ready solutions. Cloud migration still in progress. DevSecOps pipelines that need hardening. Data governance that's inconsistent across regions. These aren't failures. They are the real areas of work IT teams across the globe have in our hands.\n\nThe teams building AI innovations are doing exactly what we need them to do. They're proving what's possible, finding the edges, and showing us where the foundation cracks under pressure. That's valuable insight. Our job in IT is to strengthen that foundation fast enough to keep up with them.\n\nIt's a partnership. Innovation teams push us to modernize faster. Our modernization helps them ship faster. Neither side wins alone. We win, together!\n\nByron Clymer followed with a keynote that gave our technical audience something they don't always get: a deep look at how Lockton business works across the globe. He walked us through the insurance brokerage business from parametric insurance to emerging innovations happening across the industry. For technologists who spend their days in code and infrastructure, understanding the brokerage model we're building for matters. \n\nIt gave every technical session that followed a business foundation & context to build on.\n\nThe full Day 1 lineup:\n\n• **Summit Opening & Welcome** by Karthik Ramadoss - Introduced the \"Messy Middle\" theme, what we do about it in light of AI and the word of the summit: **Preparation**\n• **Opening Keynote** by Byron Clymer - Walked us through the insurance brokerage business and how Lockton makes money\n• **Global Enterprise Architecture Panel** by David George, James Solko, Karthik Ramadoss, Shanna Sommers - Tackled the big questions facing architecture teams across regions\n• **TechTalk: Risk Management & Compliance** by Elizabeth Thomas, David Collins - How we're thinking about security and compliance in an AI-first world\n• **Podcast: GitReal - No Merge Conflict, Just Real Talk** by Megan Matile & GitReal Team - Live recording covering real engineering culture topics\n• **Breakout: Security Track** by Joey Lamb, Raoul Hira - Hands-on security practices and threat awareness\n• **Breakout: Mulesoft Technical Expert** by Kumar Vuddaraju - API integration patterns and Mulesoft best practices\n• **Breakout: Databricks - Productionalizing AI** by Daniel Tomes, Field CTO - Moving AI from experiments to production workloads\n• **Day 1 Closing Remarks** by James Solko - Recap and setup for Day 2\n\nWe ran the breakouts Olympics-style: three teams (Canada, Norway, USA) rotating through all three tracks. Kept the energy competitive.\n\nDinner was at Boulevard Brewing. Shuffleboard happened. Ideas kept flowing.\n\n🛰️ Day 2: Getting Specific - Deep Tracks & Hard Questions\n\nThe full Day 2 lineup:\n\n• **Day 2 Welcome** by Karthik Ramadoss - Focused on AI security and hands-on tracks\n• **Keynote: AI Security** by Felix Simmons - Real attack vectors and security considerations as AI scales across the enterprise\n• **Architecture of Olympics** by Jill Hodge - Connected Olympic training principles to how we approach architecture discipline\n• **TechTalk: Affinity and Beyond - Mission 0001** by Julie Morris - Roadmap update on where Affinity is headed next\n• **TechTalk: M365 PowerPlatform** by Travis Chambers - What's actually possible with Power Platform today\n• **Breakout: AI Agents Track** by Larry Lane, Shane Strong - Building and deploying autonomous AI agents\n• **Breakout: Perficient - Dynamic Agent Frameworks** by Nico Frantzen - Patterns for flexible, adaptable agent architectures\n• **Breakout: Data & Fabric Track** by Rajesh Paul, James Solko - Data architecture foundations that enable AI at scale\n• **Day 2 Closing Remarks** by Karthik Ramadoss - Wrapped up and setup for Hackathon Day\n\nEvening: KC BBQ at Joe's. Trivia competition. Someone's team name was \"Hallucinating LLMs\" which felt appropriate.\n\nDay 3: Hackathon\n\nTeams built working AI prototypes for real Lockton problems. Not slide decks. Working code. Some of the solutions are already in conversations about production.\n\nOur Focus for 2026\n\n• Retire technical debt faster\n• Finish cloud migration\n• Double down on DevSecOps\n• Get hands-on with AI tools (what I'm calling \"AI Gym\" time)\n\nThe Numbers\n\n2024 (Atlanta): 30 attendees\n2025 (Dallas): 55 attendees\n2026 (Kansas City): 60+ attendees\n\nWhat's Next\n\nQuarterly virtual summits.
