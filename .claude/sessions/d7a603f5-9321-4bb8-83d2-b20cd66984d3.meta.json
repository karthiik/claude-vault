      "newContent": "# Innovation Pitch: Byron Clymer\n**Target Audience:** Byron Clymer, Global CIO\n**Purpose:** Secure sponsorship for IT-led AI innovation sprint, partnering with Shared Services\n**Date:** January 2026\n\n---\n\n## Storyline Summary\n\n> **The Arc:** We've proven IT can innovate (hackathon). Microsoft showed us the playbook (Kaizen + AI, business sponsorship). Now we partner with Shared Services to deliver quick, measurable wins that Tim and Nick can champion — then scale globally once credibility is built.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 1: The Moment We're In\n\n**Title:** *We Have Momentum. Now We Need a System.*\n\n**Narrative:**\n- The GAS Summit and Hackathon proved something important: **our people want to innovate**\n- We generated energy, ideas, and enthusiasm\n- But hackathon energy fades without a system to sustain it\n- **The risk:** We lose the moment. Ideas die in inboxes. People disengage.\n- **The opportunity:** Channel this energy into a repeatable engine that delivers results\n\n**Visual:** Energy wave rising (hackathon) → question mark (what's next?) → sustained rhythm (innovation system)\n\n---\n\n## Slide 2: Microsoft Showed Us the Playbook\n\n**Title:** *What We Learned in Seattle: The Recipe That Works*\n\n**Narrative:**\n- Microsoft didn't just give us inspiration — they gave us a **proven framework**\n- Kathleen Hogan (EVP, Chief Strategy & Transformation Officer) shared the recipe:\n\n| Microsoft's Innovation Recipe | What It Means for Lockton |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Kaizen First, AI Second** | Find the waste in processes → then layer AI on top |\n| **Business Leader Sponsorship** | \"Unless a business leader is sponsoring it, we don't work on it\" |\n| **Shared Services Council** | Cross-functional group to surface and prioritize opportunities |\n| **Measure the Impact** | Hard metrics, not just stories |\n\n**Key Insight:**\n> \"When you do Kaizen, you'll find a lot of waste. Then you layer in AI.\"\n\nThis isn't innovation theater — it's disciplined improvement with modern tools.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 3: Byron's Strategic Priorities Demand This\n\n**Title:** *This Aligns with Where You're Steering the Ship*\n\n**Narrative:**\nConnect directly to what Byron said at the MS briefing:\n\n| Byron's Priority | How Innovation Sprints Deliver |\n|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Scale without doing everything differently** | Repeatable framework, not one-off projects |\n| **Remove friction, cost-constrained** | Kaizen finds waste; AI automates the pain points |\n| **Data quality as table stakes** | Sprint focus on data governance and clean pipelines |\n| **Get data out for analytics** | Build the integration layer that enables reporting |\n| **Hard metrics behind ROI** | Every sprint has measurable success criteria |\n\n**The Connection:**\nYour vision: *\"IT's job is to remove friction — but cost-constrained.\"*\nThis framework delivers exactly that: **systematic friction removal, measured results**.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 4: The Approach — People Before Agents\n\n**Title:** *Workforce Enablement Unlocks Scale*\n\n**Narrative:**\nAI won't transform insurance through pilots alone. The experiments prove what works — but transformation requires enabling **every person** to benefit.\n\n**The Progression:**\n```\nLevel 1: Summarize → emails, documents, meetings\nLevel 2: Automate → action items, routine tasks\nLevel 3: Create → presentations, reports, drafts\nLevel 4: Trust → agentic workflows with human oversight\n```\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n- AI is \"jagged\" — brilliant at some things, fails at basics\n- You can't trust it blindly; you need experience to know the edges\n- **When the workforce is enabled, AI scales naturally**\n- Every person becomes AI-augmented, not just the pilot teams\n\n**Microsoft validated this:** They trained the trainer, ran mentor office hours, brought people along intentionally.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 5: Why Shared Services First\n\n**Title:** *Start Where Wins Are Visible and Cross-Functional*\n\n**Narrative:**\nWe need to build credibility before going global. Shared Services is the right starting point:\n\n| Why Shared Services? | |\n|---------------------|---|\n| **High volume, repeatable processes** | Ideal for Kaizen + AI |\n| **Cross-functional visibility** | Tim and Nick see impact across all business units |\n| **Measurable outcomes** | Cycle time, error rates, cost per transaction |\n| **Internal customers** | Lower risk than client-facing pilots |\n| **Quick wins compound** | Each improvement builds the case for scale |\n\n**Microsoft's Insight:**\n> \"Shared services should form a council to share ideas on what could be done across all areas.\"\n\nWe form that council. IT provides the enablement. Business provides the sponsorship.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 6: The Sprint Model\n\n**Title:** *From Hackathon Energy to Repeatable Rhythm*\n\n**Narrative:**\nNot random innovation — **disciplined sprints** with clear governance:\n\n| Element | How It Works |\n|---------|--------------|\n| **Sprint Duration** | 4 weeks (enough to deliver, short enough to course-correct) |\n| **Business Sponsor** | Every sprint has a Shared Services leader attached |\n| **Success Criteria** | Defined upfront — pass/fail is clear |\n| **Kaizen Phase** | Week 1: Map the process, identify waste |\n| **Build Phase** | Weeks 2-3: AI-enabled solution |\n| **Validate Phase** | Week 4: Measure, document, decide (scale/kill/iterate) |\n\n**What IT Provides:**\n- Infrastructure for secure AI deployment\n- Data governance and integration layer\n- Measurement and tracing frameworks\n- Sprint facilitation and technical enablement\n\n**What Business Provides:**\n- Process ownership and domain expertise\n- Sponsorship and prioritization\n- Change management for their teams\n- Success metrics and adoption\n\n---\n\n## Slide 7: What Tim and Nick Will See in Q2\n\n**Title:** *Tangible Wins by Mid-Year*\n\n**Narrative:**\nThis isn't a roadmap that disappears into 2027. Here's what success looks like by Q2 2026:\n\n| Win | Metric | Visibility |\n|-----|--------|-----------|\n| **3 completed sprints** | End-to-end delivery | Demonstrated capability |\n| **Measurable efficiency gains** | Hours saved, error reduction, cycle time | Hard ROI Tim/Nick can report |\n| **Enabled workforce cohort** | Shared Services team AI-fluent | Adoption, not just deployment |\n| **Documented playbook** | Repeatable for next wave | Scalability proof |\n| **Business-led sponsorship** | Not IT pushing — business pulling | Sustainable model |\n\n**The Story for Tim/Nick:**\n> \"IT partnered with us to deliver X hours saved, Y% error reduction, and a trained team ready to identify the next opportunity. We want to expand this.\"\n\nThat's the story they tell. That's credibility built.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 8: The Scale Path — After We Prove It\n\n**Title:** *Shared Services → Digital → Global*\n\n**Narrative:**\nWe're not asking to boil the ocean. We're asking to **earn the right** to scale:\n\n```\nQ1-Q2 2026: Shared Services (Build Credibility)\n    ↓\nQ3 2026: Digital (Byron champions to peer CIOs)\n    ↓\nQ4 2026+: Global expansion via regional champions\n```\n\n**Phase 1: Shared Services (Now)**\n- Partner with Tim/Nick's teams\n- Deliver 3-5 measurable wins\n- Build the playbook and train the trainers\n\n**Phase 2: Digital (Fast Follow)**\n- Digital teams see Shared Services wins\n- Byron champions the model to Digital leadership\n- Expand to client-facing process improvements\n\n**Phase 3: Global (Earned Scale)**\n- Regional CIOs adopt the proven playbook\n- Local champions trained and enabled\n- Innovation rhythm becomes Lockton standard\n\n**Why This Works:**\n- We don't oversell before we've proven\n- Each phase builds on demonstrated success\n- Global rollout has local ownership (your \"hire local CEO\" model)\n\n---\n\n## Slide 9: Addressing the Hard Questions\n\n**Title:** *What We Know You're Thinking*\n\n**Narrative:**\nBased on your concerns from Seattle, here's how we address them:\n\n| Concern | Our Answer |\n|---------|-----------|\n| **\"Insurance expects fully baked, not MVPs\"** | Sprints deliver complete solutions with human-in-the-loop — not half-built demos |\n| **\"How do we get hard metrics behind ROI?\"** | Success criteria defined before sprint starts; measured ruthlessly |\n| **\"Change management is the hard part\"** | HR business partner involved; process owner leads adoption; IT enables |\n| **\"We're skittish on global comms\"** | We don't communicate globally until we have wins to show; local first |\n| **\"Multiple cultures, need to be specific\"** | Shared Services is internal; we learn the model before going external |\n\n**Microsoft's Principle:**\n> \"Bad news is better than uncertainty. Share intent.\"\n\nWe're sharing intent: IT wants to partner with Shared Services to build a proven model. No promises we haven't earned. Credibility first.\n\n---\n\n## Slide 10: The Ask\n\n**Title:** *What We Need from You*\n\n**Narrative:**\nThis isn't a budget ask. It's a sponsorship ask.\n\n| Ask | Why It Matters |\n|-----|---------------|\n| **1. Your sponsorship** | \"Unless a business leader is sponsoring it, we don't work on it\" — we need you as the IT champion |\n| **2. Introduction to Tim/Nick** | Position this as IT partnering with Shared Services — not IT pushing a project |\n| **3. Cover for experimentation** | Some sprints will fail. We need air cover to learn fast and pivot |\n| **4. Quarterly visibility** | Brief you on progress; adjust course as needed |\n\n**What You Get:**\n- A framework that scales without doing everything differently\n- Hard metrics to demonstrate IT value\n- Workforce enablement that compounds over time\n- A story to tell at the next Executive Briefing\n\n---\n\n## Slide 11: Why This, Why Now\n\n**Title:** *The Window Is Open*\n\n**Narrative:**\nThree forces are converging:\n\n| Force | Timing |\n|-------|--------|\n| **Hackathon momentum** | People are energized *now* — energy fades fast |\n| **Microsoft playbook** | Fresh insights from Seattle; validated approach |\n| **Lockton growth targets** | $4B → $7.1B requires efficiency, not just headcount |\n\n**The Choice:**\n- **Option A:** Let momentum fade. Next hackathon in 2027. Ideas die.\n- **Option B:** Channel the energy into a system. Build credibility. Scale from strength.\n\n**One-Liner:**\n> \"AI in insurance isn't a technology project — it's a workforce transformation. Our digital investments create the foundation; now we scale by enabling every person to use it.\"\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Supporting Materials\n\n### A.

Use when asked to create a deck, presentation, or slides.\nallowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash, Glob\n---\n\n# Lockton PowerPoint Deck Generator\n\nCreate professional, on-brand Lockton presentations using the official template.\n\n## Template Location\n\n**Base Template:** `1-Projects/2026 PACE/PACE SteerCo Update - December 25.pptx`\n**Backup Template:** `Templates/Lockton powerpoint template.potx`\n\n## Template Specifications\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| **Dimensions** | 13.33\" x 7.50\" (16:9 widescreen) |\n| **Brand Colors** | Navy (#003366), Teal (#00A3AD), White, Black |\n\n## Available Slide Layouts\n\n| Index | Layout Name | Use For |\n|-------|-------------|---------|\n| **15** | Title Only_Black | Title/cover slides (dark) |\n| **16** | Title Only | Section dividers (light) |\n| **17** | Title and Content_Black | Content with dark header |\n| **18** | Title and Content_White | Content with light header |\n| **22** | One-Column Content | General content slides |\n| **19** | Copyright - Standard logo | Closing slide |\n\n## Generation Process\n\nWhen asked to create a presentation:\n\n1. **Gather Requirements**\n   - Topic/purpose\n   - Target audience\n   - Key messages (3-5 max)\n   - Desired length (# of slides)\n\n2. **Create Outline First**\n   - Draft slide titles and key points in Markdown\n   - Get user approval before generating\n\n3. **Generate Using Python Script**\n\n   Use the helper script at `.claude/skills/lockton-deck/generate_deck.py`:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 .claude/skills/lockton-deck/generate_deck.py \\\n     --template \"1-Projects/2026 PACE/PACE SteerCo Update - December 25.pptx\" \\\n     --output \"path/to/output.pptx\" \\\n     --config \"path/to/slides.json\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Export to Desktop**\n   ```bash\n   cp \"path/to/output.pptx\" ~/Desktop/\n   ```\n\n## Slide Config JSON Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"Presentation Title\",\n  \"slides\": [\n    {\n      \"layout\": 15,\n      \"title\": \"Cover Slide Title\",\n      \"subtitle\": \"Optional subtitle\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"layout\": 18,\n      \"title\": \"Content Slide\",\n      \"bullets\": [\n        \"First point\",\n        \"Second point\",\n        \"Third point\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"layout\": 16,\n      \"title\": \"Section Divider\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"layout\": 22,\n      \"title\": \"One Column Content\",\n      \"body\": \"Paragraph text or bullet points\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Keep slides simple** — 3-5 bullets max per slide\n2. **Use section dividers** — Break up content logically\n3. **Title slides** — Use layout 15 for impact\n4. **End with copyright** — Always include layout 19\n\n## Quick Generation (Inline)\n\nFor simple decks, generate directly with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom pptx import Presentation\nfrom pptx.util import Inches, Pt\n\n# Load template\nprs = Presentation('1-Projects/2026 PACE/PACE SteerCo Update - December 25.pptx')\n\n# Clear existing slides (keep layouts)\nwhile len(prs.slides) > 0:\n    rId = prs.slides._sldIdLst[0].rId\n    prs.part.drop_rel(rId)\n    del prs.slides._sldIdLst[0]\n\n# Add slides using layouts\ntitle_slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[15])  # Title Only_Black\ntitle_slide.shapes.title.text = \"Your Title Here\"\n\ncontent_slide = prs.slides.add_slide(prs.slide_layouts[18])  # Title and Content_White\ncontent_slide.shapes.title.text = \"Content Title\"\n# Find body placeholder and add content\nfor shape in content_slide.placeholders:\n    if shape.placeholder_format.idx == 10:  # Body placeholder\n        shape.text = \"• Point 1\\n• Point 2\\n• Point 3\"\n\nprs.save('output.pptx')\n```\n\n## Output\n\nAlways:\n1. Save to project folder with descriptive name\n2. Copy to `~/Desktop/` for easy access\n3. Report file location to user\n"

Don't position thesis as criticism of digital team's POCs — it's about scaling the foundation they've built.\n- **US market context:** Broker-driven, human-touch sales economy. Lower historical digital investment than UK/Europe. Fundamentals first.\n- **M-Files risk:** Brandon said 5/1 is unrealistic. Architecture design and integration build are the blockers.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Wins (for reference)\n\n| Date | Win | Goal |\n|------|-----|------|\n| 2026-01-25 | Innovation Thesis v0.1 drafted | G1 |\n| 2026-01-20 | LinkedIn post published | G1 |\n| 2026-01-22 | Innovation Sprint committee formed | G2 |\n| 2026-01-22 | Promotions finalized | G3 |\n| 2026-01-24 | Simon Sinek courses completed | Learning |\n\n---\n\n*This file is my long-term memory.

Slalom?\n\n---\n\n## Active Projects\n\n| Project | Status | Next Action |\n|---------|--------|-------------|\n| [[Innovation Thesis]] | v0.1 complete | Review with advisors (March) |\n| [[0_Innovation_Sprint_Index\\|Innovation Sprint]] | Shaping | Pitch to Byron in Seattle |\n| [[C4 Establish Global EA Practice]] | Assessment phase | Perficient proposal due 1/30 |\n| M-Files / Associate Hub | At risk | 5/1 unrealistic, reconvene this week |\n| Promotions | Details finalized | Comms target 2/1 (Larry/Mark/Brooke) |\n\n---\n\n## Open Threads (Multi-Week)\n\n### Career\n- [ ] Cheryl backfill → Enterprise Architect — pitch to Byron\n- [ ] Salesforce credits ($99K) — update Byron in 2-3 weeks\n- [ ] Naveen re: Puru promotion — follow up\n\n### Operational\n- [ ] PHENOM functional design — end of Feb target\n- [ ] Workday Workshop — beginning of March, KC office, invite Nandini & Rajesh\n- [ ] Email Hiram Morero — Producer Org needs\n- [ ] HIVE/Nuvento SOW — finalize pilot terms\n\n### Personal\n- [ ] Seattle flight — ice storm affecting, watch for cancellations\n- [ ] London trip — dates confirmed with Glenn\n\n---\n\n## Important Nuances\n\n- **Innovation framing:** Additive, not critical. Don't position thesis as criticism of digital team's POCs — it's about scaling the foundation they've built.\n- **US market context:** Broker-driven, human-touch sales economy. Lower historical digital investment than UK/Europe. Fundamentals first.\n- **M-Files risk:** Brandon said 5/1 is unrealistic. Architecture design and integration build are the blockers.\n\n---\n\n## Recent Wins (for reference)\n\n| Date | Win | Goal |\n|------|-----|------|\n| 2026-01-25 | Innovation Thesis v0.1 drafted | G1 |\n| 2026-01-20 | LinkedIn post published | G1 |\n| 2026-01-22 | Innovation Sprint committee formed | G2 |\n| 2026-01-22 | Promotions finalized | G3 |\n| 2026-01-24 | Simon Sinek courses completed | Learning |\n\n---\n\n## Tools & Preferences\n\n### PowerPoint Presentations\n- **Always use Lockton branding** — never generate generic decks\n- **Skill:** `/lockton-deck` — creates branded presentations\n- **Template:** `1-Projects/2026 PACE/PACE SteerCo Update - December 25.pptx`\n- **Dimensions:** 13.33\" x 7.50\" (16:9)\n- **Key layouts:** Title_Black (15), Title_Light (16), Content_White (18), One-Column (22)\n- **Export to:** `~/Desktop/` for easy access\n\n---\n\n*This file is my long-term memory.
