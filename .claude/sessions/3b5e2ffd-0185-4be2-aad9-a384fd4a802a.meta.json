Gather Context\n\nRead these files to understand the current state:\n\n- **Today's daily note** (`Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — calendar, any pre-populated items\n- **Yesterday's daily note** — action items, evening close, meeting notes\n- **Day before yesterday** (if relevant) — for continuity on multi-day threads\n- **AGENDA.md** — open threads, current focus areas, recent activity\n\n### 2. Analyze Today's Calendar\n\nFor each meeting on today's calendar:\n- What's the context? (Check recent notes for related discussions)\n- Who will be there? (Any recent 1:1s or interactions with them?)\n- What might I need to prepare?\n- Are there open action items related to this meeting?\n\n### 3. Surface Open Threads\n\nFrom the last 2-3 days, identify:\n- **Unfinished action items** — especially #p1 and career-aligned tasks\n- **Waiting items** — things blocked on others\n- **Recurring themes** — people, projects, or topics that keep coming up\n- **Commitments made** — things you said you'd do\n\n### 4. Connect the Dots\n\nLook for patterns and connections:\n- Which meetings today relate to yesterday's discussions?\n- Are there people you're meeting who you have open items with?\n- What project threads are active right now?\n- Any deadlines approaching?\n\n### 5. Generate Morning Brief\n\nPresent a concise morning brief with:\n\n```markdown\n## ☀️ Morning Brief — [Day, Date]\n\n### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority\n[Based on action items, calendar, and career goals — what's THE most important thing today?]\n\n### 📅 Today's Meetings — Context & Prep\n| Time | Meeting | Context | Prep Needed |\n|------|---------|---------|-------------|\n| HH:MM | [Meeting] | [What this relates to] | [Any prep?] |\n\n### 🔥 Open Threads to Track\n- [Thread 1] — from [date], status: [status]\n- [Thread 2] — from [date], status: [status]\n\n### 🔗 Connections Today\n- [Person X] — you have open item: [item]\n- [Meeting Y] connects to [Project Z] from yesterday\n\n### ⚠️ Heads Up\n- [Anything time-sensitive or noteworthy]\n```\n\n### 6. Set #1 Priority\n\nAsk the user to confirm or adjust the suggested #1 priority, then update today's daily note.\n\n### 7. Career Goal Check\n\nQuick reminder of which career goals (G1/G2/G3) today's activities support:\n- G1: External Visibility\n- G2: Innovation Leadership\n- G3: Role Transition\n\n## Notes\n\n- Keep the brief scannable — bullet points, tables\n- Prioritize actionable insights over information dumps\n- Flag anything that needs immediate attention\n- If a meeting has no context from recent notes, note that (might need prep)\n- Link to relevant notes using `[[wikilinks]]` so user can click through\n"

Gather Context\n\nRead these files to understand the current state:\n\n- **Today's daily note** (`Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — calendar, any pre-populated items\n- **Yesterday's daily note** — action items, evening close, meeting notes\n- **Day before yesterday** (if relevant) — for continuity on multi-day threads\n- **AGENDA.md** — open threads, current focus areas, recent activity\n\n### 2. Analyze Today's Calendar\n\nFor each meeting on today's calendar:\n- What's the context? (Check recent notes for related discussions)\n- Who will be there? (Any recent 1:1s or interactions with them?)\n- What might I need to prepare?\n- Are there open action items related to this meeting?\n\n### 3. Surface Open Threads\n\nFrom the last 2-3 days, identify:\n- **Unfinished action items** — especially #p1 and career-aligned tasks\n- **Waiting items** — things blocked on others\n- **Recurring themes** — people, projects, or topics that keep coming up\n- **Commitments made** — things you said you'd do\n\n### 4. Connect the Dots\n\nLook for patterns and connections:\n- Which meetings today relate to yesterday's discussions?\n- Are there people you're meeting who you have open items with?\n- What project threads are active right now?\n- Any deadlines approaching?\n\n### 5. Generate Morning Brief\n\nPresent a concise morning brief with:\n\n```markdown\n## ☀️ Morning Brief — [Day, Date]\n\n### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority\n[Based on action items, calendar, and career goals — what's THE most important thing today?]\n\n### 📅 Today's Meetings — Context & Prep\n| Time | Meeting | Context | Prep Needed |\n|------|---------|---------|-------------|\n| HH:MM | [Meeting] | [What this relates to] | [Any prep?] |\n\n### 🔥 Open Threads to Track\n- [Thread 1] — from [date], status: [status]\n- [Thread 2] — from [date], status: [status]\n\n### 🔗 Connections Today\n- [Person X] — you have open item: [item]\n- [Meeting Y] connects to [Project Z] from yesterday\n\n### ⚠️ Heads Up\n- [Anything time-sensitive or noteworthy]\n```\n\n### 6. Set #1 Priority\n\nAsk the user to confirm or adjust the suggested #1 priority, then update today's daily note.\n\n### 7. Career Goal Check\n\nQuick reminder of which career goals (G1/G2/G3) today's activities support:\n- G1: External Visibility\n- G2: Innovation Leadership\n- G3: Role Transition\n\n## Notes\n\n- Keep the brief scannable — bullet points, tables\n- Prioritize actionable insights over information dumps\n- Flag anything that needs immediate attention\n- If a meeting has no context from recent notes, note that (might need prep)\n- Link to relevant notes using `[[wikilinks]]` so user can click through\n",
      "newContent": "# Start Day\n\nExecute the morning startup routine to prepare for the day ahead.\n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Gather Context\n\nRead these sources to understand the current state:\n\n**Obsidian:**\n- **Today's daily note** (`Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — calendar, any pre-populated items\n- **Yesterday's daily note** — action items, evening close, meeting notes\n- **Day before yesterday** (if relevant) — for continuity on multi-day threads\n- **AGENDA.md** — open threads, current focus areas, recent activity\n\n**Things 3:**\n- Run `./cli.sh things today` — tasks scheduled for today\n- Run `./cli.sh things anytime` — upcoming tasks that might be relevant\n- Run `./cli.sh things areas` — tasks grouped by life area (Health, Career, Learning, etc.)\n\n**Career Goals:**\n- Read `2-Areas/Career & Purpose/2026 Career Goals.md` for G1/G2/G3 alignment\n\n### 2. Cross-Reference: Things 3 ↔ Meetings ↔ Action Items\n\n**For each meeting today:**\n1. Search Things 3 tasks for keywords matching the meeting topic or attendees\n2. Search yesterday's/recent action items for related tasks\n3. Check if any Things 3 task is a prerequisite for the meeting\n4. Flag if there's prep work that hasn't been done\n\n**Correlation examples:**\n- Meeting: \"EA Assessment with Perficient\" → Things task: \"Complete EA assessment\" → **Prep needed!**\n- Meeting: \"Byron 1:1\" → Action item: \"Synthesize survey results for Byron\" → **Bring this up**\n- Meeting: \"Nate catch-up\" → Yesterday's notes mention Producer Org → **Continue discussion**\n\n### 3. Surface Open Threads\n\nFrom the last 2-3 days, identify:\n- **Unfinished action items** — especially #p1 and career-aligned tasks\n- **Things 3 tasks due today/overdue** — anything that needs attention\n- **Waiting items** — things blocked on others\n- **Recurring themes** — people, projects, or topics that keep coming up\n- **Commitments made** — things you said you'd do\n\n### 4. Connect the Dots\n\nLook for patterns and connections:\n- Which meetings today relate to yesterday's discussions?\n- Are there people you're meeting who you have open items with?\n- Which Things 3 tasks align with today's meetings?\n- What project threads are active right now?\n- Any deadlines approaching?\n\n### 5. Generate Morning Brief\n\nPresent a concise morning brief with:\n\n```markdown\n## ☀️ Morning Brief — [Day, Date]\n\n### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority\n[Based on action items, Things 3, calendar, and career goals — what's THE most important thing today?]\n\n### 📅 Today's Meetings — Context & Prep\n| Time | Meeting | Context | Things 3 Tasks | Prep Needed |\n|------|---------|---------|----------------|-------------|\n| HH:MM | [Meeting] | [What this relates to] | [Related tasks] | [Yes/No - what?] |\n\n### ✅ Things 3: Today\n[List tasks from Things 3 Today list, noting which connect to meetings]\n\n### 🔥 Open Threads to Track\n- [Thread 1] — from [date], status: [status]\n- [Thread 2] — from [date], status: [status]\n\n### 🔗 Connections Today\n- [Person X] — you have open item: [item]\n- [Meeting Y] connects to Things task: [task]\n- [Meeting Z] continues from yesterday's [topic]\n\n### ⚠️ Heads Up\n- [Anything time-sensitive or noteworthy]\n- [Prep work not yet done]\n- [Deadlines this week]\n```\n\n### 6. Set #1 Priority\n\nAsk the user to confirm or adjust the suggested #1 priority, then update today's daily note in the `## 🎯 #1 Priority` section.\n\n### 7. Career Goal Check\n\nQuick reminder of which career goals (G1/G2/G3) today's activities support:\n- G1: External Visibility\n- G2: Innovation Leadership\n- G3: Role Transition\n\n## CLI Commands Used\n\n```bash\n# Things 3 queries\n./cli.sh things today      # Today's tasks with areas\n./cli.sh things anytime    # Upcoming tasks\n./cli.sh things areas      # Tasks grouped by area\n\n# Obsidian tasks\n./cli.sh tasks --p1        # High priority vault tasks\n./cli.sh read \"Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md\"  # Read daily notes\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n- Keep the brief scannable — bullet points, tables\n- Prioritize actionable insights over information dumps\n- **Highlight correlations** — when a Things 3 task relates to a meeting, make it obvious\n- Flag anything that needs immediate attention\n- If a meeting has no context from recent notes AND no Things 3 tasks, note that (might need prep)\n- Link to relevant notes using `[[wikilinks]]` so user can click through\n"
