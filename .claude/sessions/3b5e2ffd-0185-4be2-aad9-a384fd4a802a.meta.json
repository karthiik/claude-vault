Gather Context\n\nRead these files to understand the current state:\n\n- **Today's daily note** (`Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — calendar, any pre-populated items\n- **Yesterday's daily note** — action items, evening close, meeting notes\n- **Day before yesterday** (if relevant) — for continuity on multi-day threads\n- **AGENDA.md** — open threads, current focus areas, recent activity\n\n### 2. Analyze Today's Calendar\n\nFor each meeting on today's calendar:\n- What's the context? (Check recent notes for related discussions)\n- Who will be there? (Any recent 1:1s or interactions with them?)\n- What might I need to prepare?\n- Are there open action items related to this meeting?\n\n### 3. Surface Open Threads\n\nFrom the last 2-3 days, identify:\n- **Unfinished action items** — especially #p1 and career-aligned tasks\n- **Waiting items** — things blocked on others\n- **Recurring themes** — people, projects, or topics that keep coming up\n- **Commitments made** — things you said you'd do\n\n### 4. Connect the Dots\n\nLook for patterns and connections:\n- Which meetings today relate to yesterday's discussions?\n- Are there people you're meeting who you have open items with?\n- What project threads are active right now?\n- Any deadlines approaching?\n\n### 5. Generate Morning Brief\n\nPresent a concise morning brief with:\n\n```markdown\n## ☀️ Morning Brief — [Day, Date]\n\n### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority\n[Based on action items, calendar, and career goals — what's THE most important thing today?]\n\n### 📅 Today's Meetings — Context & Prep\n| Time | Meeting | Context | Prep Needed |\n|------|---------|---------|-------------|\n| HH:MM | [Meeting] | [What this relates to] | [Any prep?] |\n\n### 🔥 Open Threads to Track\n- [Thread 1] — from [date], status: [status]\n- [Thread 2] — from [date], status: [status]\n\n### 🔗 Connections Today\n- [Person X] — you have open item: [item]\n- [Meeting Y] connects to [Project Z] from yesterday\n\n### ⚠️ Heads Up\n- [Anything time-sensitive or noteworthy]\n```\n\n### 6. Set #1 Priority\n\nAsk the user to confirm or adjust the suggested #1 priority, then update today's daily note.\n\n### 7. Career Goal Check\n\nQuick reminder of which career goals (G1/G2/G3) today's activities support:\n- G1: External Visibility\n- G2: Innovation Leadership\n- G3: Role Transition\n\n## Notes\n\n- Keep the brief scannable — bullet points, tables\n- Prioritize actionable insights over information dumps\n- Flag anything that needs immediate attention\n- If a meeting has no context from recent notes, note that (might need prep)\n- Link to relevant notes using `[[wikilinks]]` so user can click through\n"
