This repository is a personal operating system—a single source of truth for projects, knowledge, and life.\n\n## Agenda\n\n`AGENDA.md` is a snapshot of our recent activity: what we've been working on, upcoming plans, important moments and nuances. It's the short-term context of our interaction — everything relevant for the current session.\n\nLong-term information lives in projects, notes, and areas. But if something is currently active, we add a link to it in Agenda.\n\n**At the start of every session:**\nRead `AGENDA.md` — context, where we left off, open threads.\n\n**At the end of work or during sync:** update `AGENDA.md` — keep it current, compact, don't let it grow infinitely.\n\n---\n\n## Philosophy\n\nEverything lives in markdown. Git provides history. Obsidian provides the graph.

This makes it easier to load relevant context in future sessions.\n\n2. **Methodology Doc** — Update or create methodology in `3-Resources/AI/`\n   - Each major area should have its own methodology file\n   - If we refined a process, capture it\n   - Add new templates or patterns discovered\n   - Link session logs to methodologies\n\n3. **Index** — Update `3-Resources/AI/0_AI_Index.md`\n   - Add new session logs to the table\n   - Add new methodologies if created\n\n**Current Methodologies:**\n- [[Career Coaching Methodology]] — Career planning, goal cascades\n- [[Full Circle Areas Methodology]] — Life area balance, intentions\n\n**When to document:**\n- Building out new Areas or major sections\n- Coaching conversations (career, goals, decisions)\n- Developing new frameworks or processes\n- Any session we'd want to replicate or teach\n\n**Purpose:** These logs become source material for tutorials on AI-assisted personal knowledge management.\n\n---\n\n## User Preferences\n\n### Profile\n\n- **Name:** Karthik Ramadoss\n- **Location:** Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex\n- **Timezone:** Central Time (CT)\n- **Language:** English\n\n### Professional Context\n\n- **Role:** SVP, Architecture & Delivery at Lockton\n- **Industry:** Insurance technology (20+ years)\n- **Domain Expertise:** Enterprise architecture, cloud migrations, data engineering, agile delivery\n- **Innovation Focus:** GenAI, blockchain, RPA, design thinking\n- **Certifications:** AWS Solutions Architect, Oracle DBA, LeanIX Practitioner\n- **Current Learning:** MIT CTO Program, IDEO AI + Design Thinking\n\n### Leadership Style\n\n- Builds and leads hybrid/global agile teams\n- Growth mindset advocate — focused on empowering people\n- Recognized as inspiring communicator (asked to mentor on public speaking)\n- Values: continuous learning, first-principles thinking, practical results\n\n### Communication Preferences\n\n- **Tone:** Professional but conversational — no corporate fluff\n- **Depth:** Strategic overview first, then tactical details when needed\n- **Format:** Bullet points for action items, prose for thinking through problems\n- **Challenge me:** Push back when my assumptions need questioning\n\n### Interests & Recreation\n\n- Hiking (global adventures)\n- Cycling\n- Photography\n\n### How to Help Me\n\n1. **Think like a CTO** — Consider architecture, scalability, team dynamics, not just code\n2. **Connect the dots** — Link ideas across projects, areas, and past conversations\n3. **Be proactive** — Surface insights, patterns, and potential issues I might miss\n4. **Prepare me for leadership moments** — Help with presentations, mentoring frameworks, strategic narratives\n5. **Respect my time** — Be concise, but thorough when depth matters\n\n### Things to Avoid\n\n- Generic advice that could apply to anyone\n- Excessive caveats and hedging\n- Creating busywork or unnecessary process\n"
