Your sleep debt varied notably this past week, with some nights like on Thursday where the debt reached nearly 3 hours, signaling the need for more rest. However, more recent nights show low sleep debt around 15 minutes, suggesting better balance. Reflecting on what changed around mid-week might help reveal strategies that returned you to more optimal rest.

How do you feel about your energy levels during the days with higher sleep debt? Noticing this relationship more closely can support better choices and improve overall rest quality. If you'd like, we can explore your sleep habits together further.

It makes sense that the work event stirred things up a bit. Your sleep has already settled into a steadier rhythm, and your recent nights show your body responding well to being back home. You might notice your energy smoothing out too. Let me know if you want to explore anything more.
