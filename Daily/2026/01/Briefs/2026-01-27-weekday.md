# Morning Brief — 2026-01-27

Good morning, Karthik. Here's your brief for **Monday, January 27, 2026**.

## 🎯 The One Thing

**Execute on the Microsoft/Byron face time in Seattle.** You're on the ground today — this is prime informal pitch territory for the Innovation Sprint. The thesis is done, the deadline is pushed to 2/7. Today's job: be present, build rapport, plant seeds before formal asks.

---

## 📅 Calendar Shape

- **Microsoft Visit in Redmond** — All day meetings with Byron, Glenn, TJ, Brandon, Bret
- **IT Daily Stand Up** — You'll likely miss or dial in briefly from Redmond
- **DRC Dallas annual event** — Appears on calendar but you're in Seattle — delegate or note absence

Travel recovery day. Yesterday was rough (ice storm delays, airport grind). Pace yourself — save energy for strategic conversations, not busywork.

---

## ✅ Top 3 Priorities

1. **Shape the Innovation Sprint narrative** for Byron — conversational, not formal. Frame it as "what's next after the thesis" over dinner/drinks
2. **Crema/Certs conversation** with Byron — on your Things list, knock it out during downtime
3. **Observe and learn** at Microsoft meetings — feed insights into EA Practice pitch (G4)

---

## ⚡ Quick Win

**Text Nav about Puru promotion** — open thread from last week. 2 minutes while waiting between sessions.

---

## ⚠️ Watch Out

**Burnout from yesterday.** Bad travel day + early grind = low reserves. Don't try to do too much. Pick 1-2 meaningful conversations with Byron and call it a win.

---

**Spark:** You wrote in yesterday's capture: "Super tired." That's real. Emergence isn't about grinding harder — it's about showing up at the right moments. Today has a few of those. Be present for them.
