# Morning Brief — 2026-01-28

Good morning, Karthik. Here's your brief for **Tuesday, January 28, 2026**.

---

### 🎯 The One Thing
**Pitch the Innovation Sprint to Byron informally during the Seattle/Redmond trip.** This is your window — you're together all day with dinner. Have the 2-minute pitch ready for drinks. Connects directly to G2 (Innovation Leadership) and G4 (Global EA Practice).

---

### 📅 Calendar Shape
- **All-day:** Microsoft Executive Briefing in Redmond — meetings all day with dinner
- **7:00 AM:** Sectionals (1 hour early block)
- **IT Daily Stand Up** at some point

This is a **relationship and learning day**, not a heads-down execution day. Your brief windows are early morning and late evening.

---

### 🔺 Top 3 Priorities
1. **Innovation Sprint pitch** — Have your informal 2-minute version ready for Byron over dinner or drinks
2. **Synthesize Summit & Hackathon survey results** — Prep deck for Byron (he expects this + Innovation Sprint plan)
3. **Promotion comms prep** — Target 2/1, Larry/Mark/Brooke — keep momentum

---

### ⚡ Quick Win
**Call Nav on Puru promotion** — 10-minute call to close this loop. It's been sitting in open threads.

---

### ⚠️ Watch Out
**Don't let the Microsoft briefings consume all your mental energy.** The real work today is the Byron relationship — Microsoft content is context, not the deliverable. Stay engaged but preserve bandwidth for the informal Innovation Sprint conversation.
