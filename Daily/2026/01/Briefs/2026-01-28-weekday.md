# Morning Brief — 2026-01-28

Good morning, Karthik. Here's your brief for **Tuesday, January 28, 2026**.

---

### The One Thing
**Nail the Microsoft Visit debrief and stay connected virtually.** While the team is on-site in Redmond, you're supporting remotely — your job is to capture action items, synthesize insights, and ensure nothing falls through the cracks from yesterday's grueling travel day.

---

### Calendar Shape
- **Early morning:** Sectionals (7-8 AM)
- **Mid-morning:** IT Daily Stand Up
- **All day:** Microsoft Visit continues (you're virtual)
- **Evening:** Prep for KC trip tomorrow → NYC Thursday

Light meeting load for you personally. Use blocks between check-ins for deep work.

### Top 3 Priorities
1. **Synthesize Summit & Hackathon survey results** — Byron needs the deck; this feeds the Innovation Sprint pitch
2. **Document Microsoft Visit notes virtually** — Capture key conversations and action items from the team
3. **Finalize Innovation Thesis refinements** — Q2 deadline, momentum from v0.1 complete

---

### Quick Win
**Book the NYC trip with Glenn** — get it off your list, clear mental space.

---

### Watch Out
Yesterday's airport marathon + smoke detector chaos = **energy debt**. Don't overschedule deep work. Build in recovery margin.

**Spark:** *"Emergence isn't always dramatic. Sometimes it's just showing up — tired, grounded, still moving forward."*
