# Morning Brief — 2026-01-26

Good morning, Karthik. Here's your brief for **Sunday, January 26, 2026**.

---

### 1. The One Thing
**Execute Seattle travel flawlessly.** Your flight (AA 707, 7:10 AM) gets you to Redmond for the Microsoft visit. This trip is your informal pitch window with Byron for the Innovation Sprint (G2) — arrive prepared and rested.

### 2. Calendar Shape
- **Early morning:** Flight departure DFW → SEA (7:10 AM - 11:37 AM)
- **Travel day:** No substantive meetings — use flight time for prep
- **Note:** IT Daily Stand-Up is on calendar but you'll be airborne — likely won't attend

### 3. Top 3 Priorities
1. **Board the flight** — Check in, TSA, gate. Everything else is secondary.
2. **Prepare Byron talking points** — Use flight time to refine your Innovation Sprint informal pitch; he wants business outcomes, not tech demos
3. **Call Nav re: Puru promotion** — If possible before boarding; it's on your Things list

### 4. Quick Win
**Call Baylor** for pre-bloodwork scheduling (2/3 appointment) — 5 minutes while waiting at the gate.

### 5. Watch Out
**Ice storm risk** — You flagged Seattle flight concerns in Memory. Monitor flight status. Have a backup plan if delays cascade.

**Spark:** Travel is transition. Today you move from planning to presence — from thesis to pitch. *Emergence* isn't just an idea; it's showing up when it matters.
