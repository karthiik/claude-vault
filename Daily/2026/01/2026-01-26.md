Generated by AI. Be sure to check for accuracy.

Meeting notes:

- **Producer Fee Agreement Migration Project Overview:** Jessica, Kristen, and Heather provided an overview of the project to migrate producer fee agreements from various storage locations into Onit, emphasizing its importance for revenue collection and leadership visibility, and outlined the roles and expectations for the IT team.
    - **Project Scope and Objectives:** Jessica explained that the project involves finding and migrating producer fee agreements from disparate sources such as ImageRight, OneDrive, SharePoint, and shared drives into Onit, with the goal of centralizing agreements to improve revenue collection and operational efficiency.
    - **Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities:** Jessica and Kristen clarified that Kristen will serve as the project manager, Heather represents legal operations, and the IT team is expected to review provided documentation to understand their functional requirements and estimate resource needs.
    - **Integration with Revenue Optimization:** Heather noted that this migration is the first step in a larger revenue optimization initiative led by Nick Soralt, aiming to identify missing agreements and recover lost revenue.
    - **Parallel Project Streams:** Heather described that the migration of existing agreements and the build-out of Onit for new agreements will run in parallel, with Onit eventually replacing Seismic as the platform for brokers to create and manage fee and client service agreements.
- **Technical Architecture and Platform Decisions:** Kristen, Heather, Raoul, Rajesh, and others discussed the technical architecture, including the shift from AWS to Azure, the use of Cognizer AI for document discovery, middleware options, and the need for further architectural review with the vendor.
    - **Cloud Platform Selection:** Kristen confirmed that, based on feedback, the solution will leverage Azure instead of AWS, and the vendor has agreed to support this change.
    - **Cognizer AI Functionality:** Heather explained that Cognizer AI agents will crawl designated repositories, classify contracts, de-duplicate records, and support OCR and contract hierarchy creation, with queries and migration processes to be defined by the implementation partner.
    - **Middleware and Database Choices:** Rajesh and Raoul raised questions about the use of PostgreSQL versus Azure SQL and the potential use of Workato or Azure-native middleware (e.g., Logic Apps, Functions), with Heather indicating flexibility and openness to IT-preferred alternatives.
    - **Architecture Review Planning:** Kristen and Raoul agreed on the need for a dedicated architecture review with Cognizer to clarify middleware, RBAC, support responsibilities, and integration points, with team members invited to submit questions for the vendor.
- **Data Discovery, Scoping, and Migration Process:** Heather, Aaron, KC- Situation Room, and others discussed the approach for identifying, scoping, and migrating agreements, including repository selection, document limits, and the handling of legacy and new data during and after migration.
    - **Repository Selection and Scoping:** Aaron and Heather clarified that the scan will target specific, known locations (e.g., producers' OneDrives, designated SharePoint sites, ImageRight folders) rather than all possible storage, with requirements gathering sessions planned to identify exact repositories.
    - **Document Volume and Cost Management:** Heather noted that Cognizer can crawl up to one million documents before incurring additional costs, influencing the decision to exclude email/Exchange and to carefully scope the scan to avoid unnecessary data processing.
    - **Migration and Duplication Handling:** Heather explained that Cognizer de-duplicates records and that, initially, hot links to original documents will be created, with actual copies moved to Onit at a later stage; decisions about purging legacy data will be addressed in future workshops.
    - **Coordination with M Files and Other Systems:** KC- Situation Room and Heather discussed the need to avoid conflicting migrations (e.g., to M Files) during this project, and to coordinate on requirements for regulatory compliance and potential dual storage or pointers.
- **Access, Security, and Support Considerations:** Aaron, Raoul, Heather, and others addressed access provisioning, security models, support responsibilities, and the need to define RBAC and maintenance for both the migration process and the Onit platform.
    - **Access Provisioning:** Jessica and Aaron discussed that SharePoint and OneDrive access will be managed by Aaron's team, while S Drive and ImageRight access will require coordination with service desk and IT leads, with a need to identify specific folders and service accounts for scanning.
    - **Security and Role-Based Access Control:** Heather described that Onit will use participant-based security, with access restricted by series and role (e.g., COO, legal, finance), and that metadata attached during migration will facilitate group-based access controls.
    - **Support and Maintenance Responsibilities:** Heather confirmed that Lockton IT will be responsible for maintaining infrastructure components deployed in their environment, while the implementation partner will support the application logic and code during the project.
    - **Backup and Regulatory Compliance:** James and Heather discussed the need to ensure backup provisions for migrated contracts and to address regulatory requirements for linking contracts to client files, with ongoing conversations planned to finalize these aspects.
- **Project Timelines, Next Steps, and Open Questions:** Heather, Kristen, Raoul, and others reviewed the aggressive project timeline, identified the need for further clarification on permissions and architecture, and outlined next steps including follow-up meetings, vendor discussions, and documentation review.
    - **Project Timeline and Milestones:** Heather stated that the contract anticipates a 10-day window post-signature to set up Azure BLOB storage and begin migration, with the overall project expected to last six to seven months, though delays are anticipated due to process harmonization and build-out.
    - **Concerns and Negotiation Points:** Raoul and Heather identified the 10-day setup as a potential red flag, agreeing that the timeline can be negotiated based on IT's assessment of what is reasonable to keep the project on track.
    - **Next Steps and Action Items:** Kristen and Heather committed to scheduling follow-up meetings for continued discussion, collecting questions for the vendor, and organizing an architecture review with Cognizer, inviting team members to participate and submit their queries.
    - **Leveraging Existing Knowledge:** Heather and KC- Situation Room agreed to share existing data on current agreement storage locations to streamline requirements gathering and avoid redundant outreach to business units.

Follow-up tasks:

- **Review of Project Documentation:** Review the Word document with in-depth project documentation sent by Kristen to ensure understanding of requests for each functional area. (the team)
- **Architecture and Infrastructure Clarification:** Schedule and conduct an architecture review meeting with Cognizer to discuss setup, required permissions, middleware options, and infrastructure components for the project. (Kristen, Raoul)
- **Access Provisioning Requirements:** Identify and document the specific group folders and repositories to be scanned, and determine the service accounts and permissions needed for SharePoint, OneDrive, and S Drive access. (Aaron, the team)
- **Timeline Feasibility Feedback:** Provide feedback on the feasibility of the 10-day setup timeline for Azure BLOB storage and access provisioning, and communicate a reasonable alternative to update the contract if necessary. (Raoul, Heather)
- **Database and Middleware Preferences:** Clarify with the vendor whether PostgreSQL is required or if Azure SQL can be used, and discuss alternatives to Workato for middleware to align with internal preferences. (Rajesh, Raoul, Heather)
- **M Files and Onit Integration Coordination:** Share existing data and insights on current fee agreement storage locations across series with Heather to support repository scoping and avoid redundant requirements gathering. (KC- Situation Room)
- **Backup and Security Requirements for Onit:** Confirm with the vendor that appropriate backup procedures and role-based access controls are in place for documents stored in Onit, and ensure contract language reflects these requirements. (Heather)
