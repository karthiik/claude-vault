## ☀️ Morning Brief

<!-- Generated by /startday — run each morning to populate -->

### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority

> **Start the Innovation Thesis — answer the 3 prompt questions** (G1: External Visibility). January milestone, ~7 days left, not started. This is the highest-leverage deep work for a quiet Saturday. Seattle next week gives you a natural pitch moment — having thesis clarity sharpens everything.

### 📅 Today's Meetings — Context & Prep

*No meetings today — it's Saturday. Protect this for deep work.*

### ✅ Things 3: Today

- ~~Synthesize Summit & Hackathon survey results → deck for Byron~~ *(deadline pushed to 2/7)*
- ~~Create Innovation Sprint plan → deliver to Byron~~ *(deadline pushed to 2/7)*
- Setup call with Brandon (Salesforce) *(due today)*
- Submit expenses
- Research Larry Claude setup
- Share mockup to Megan
- Add countries in LeanIX
- Confirm London dates with Glenn

### 🔥 Open Threads to Track

- **Innovation thesis** — Jan milestone: answer 3 prompt questions (G1) #p1 ⚠️ NOT STARTED
- **Innovation Sprint pitch** — shape for Seattle next week, Byron over drinks (G2)
- **Perficient EA Assessment proposal** — due 1/30, 6 days away (G3/G4)
- **M-Files rollout** — Brandon said 5/1 unrealistic, reconvene next week
- **Promotions comms** — confirm with Jenna/Megan (Larry $175K, Mark $146K, Brooke $130K) — target 2/1
- **HIVE/Nuvento SOW** — finalize pilot terms (G2)
- **Cheryl backfill → Enterprise Architect** — pitch to Byron (G3)
- **Naveen re: Puru promotion** — follow up
- **Email Hiram Morero** — Producer Org needs
- **PHENOM** — contract signed, end of Feb functional design target
- **Workday Workshop** — beginning of March, KC office, invite Nandini & Rajesh

### 🔗 Connections Today

- **Seattle next week** — Innovation Sprint pitch to Byron. Today's thesis work feeds directly into that narrative.
- **Darren/PACE** — India GCC timing is June. Volunteered to help with Deloitte delivery mix.
- **Jack Kelly** — offered reference architecture help for Client Portal AI agent. Follow up when back.

### ⚠️ Heads Up

1. **January milestone at risk** — Innovation thesis (3 prompt questions) not started. Only ~7 days left in Jan.
2. **Perficient EA Assessment** — proposal due 1/30 (next Friday). Follow up if not received Monday.
3. **Byron deadlines relaxed** — Sprint plan + survey synthesis pushed to 2/7. Use this breathing room for the thesis.
4. **Seattle next week** — your window to pitch Innovation Sprint informally. Come prepared.
5. **M-Files reconvene next week** — architecture design and integration build identified as a risk.
