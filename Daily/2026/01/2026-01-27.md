## ☀️ Morning Brief — Tuesday, January 27, 2026

*Seattle trip canceled due to ice storm. Joining Microsoft Visit virtually from Dallas.*

### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority

> **Use the recovered time to prep the Innovation Sprint deck for Byron.** The informal dinner pitch is lost, but you can turn this into execution time. Get the **survey synthesis** polished and **Innovation Sprint plan** sharpened — you'll need these before the 2/7 deadline anyway. Schedule a 1:1 with Byron this week to deliver the pitch you would've given in Seattle. (G2: Innovation Leadership)

### 📅 Today's Schedule — Engagement Map

| Time | Meeting | Mode | Your Engagement | Multitask Window? |
|------|---------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| All Day | **Microsoft Visit — Virtual** | 🖥️ Teams | Active listening, contribute when relevant | ⚡ Low-engagement segments |
| 09:30 | ~~M-Files Integration~~ | – | **CANCELED** | ✅ Free |
| 10:00 | Lockton & Deloitte | 🖥️ Teams | Active — Shanna + new resources | ❌ Engaged |
| TBD | AH Sprint 3 Review | 🖥️ Teams | Light — listen for issues | ⚡ Background OK |
| Evening | DRC Dallas annual event | 🏢 Local | **Optional** — you're in Dallas! | Consider attending |

**Virtual Reality:** You'll be a face on a screen while the team is in-person. Stay visible — camera on, nod, ask 1-2 good questions. But use low-engagement windows (demos, deep technical dives not in your lane) for focused work.

### ⚡ Multitask Priorities (for low-engagement windows)

| Priority | Task | Time Needed | Why Now |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | **Synthesize survey deck** — polish key themes | 45-60 min | Due 1/30, feeds Innovation Sprint |
| 2️⃣ | **Call Nav on Puru promotion** | 15 min | Open thread, close it |
| 3️⃣ | **Book NYC Glenn/Claude trip** | 10 min | Quick win, off the list |
| 4️⃣ | **Thomas - 90 day plan** | 30 min | Draft outline |
| 5️⃣ | **Schedule Byron 1:1** | 5 min | Replace the lost Seattle pitch |

### ✅ Things 3: Today

- **Synthesize Summit & Hackathon survey results → deck for Byron** 📅 1/30 ← Polish during low-engagement
- **Talk to Byron on Crema/Certs** ← Schedule separate call or Teams chat
- **Book NYC Glenn/Claude trip** ← Quick win
- **Thomas - Create 90 day plan** ← If time
- **Call Nav on Puru promotion** ← Close this thread

### 🔥 Open Threads to Track

| Thread | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Innovation Thesis** | ✅ v0.1 COMPLETE | [[Innovation Thesis]] done! |
| **Innovation Sprint pitch** | 🔄 Lost Seattle window | Schedule Byron 1:1 this week |
| **Perficient EA proposal** | ⏳ Due Thu 1/30 | Follow up Wed if silent |
| **Forrester EA Assessment** | ⏳ Waiting on Jonathan Jenkins | G4 |
| **M-Files rollout** | 🔄 Meeting canceled | Reconvene next week |

### 🔗 Connections Today (Virtual)
