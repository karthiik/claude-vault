## ☀️ Morning Brief — Tuesday, January 27, 2026

*Seattle trip canceled due to ice storm. Joining Microsoft Visit virtually from Dallas.*

### 🎯 Suggested #1 Priority

> **Use the recovered time to prep the Innovation Sprint deck for Byron.** The informal dinner pitch is lost, but you can turn this into execution time. Get the **survey synthesis** polished and **Innovation Sprint plan** sharpened — you'll need these before the 2/7 deadline anyway. Schedule a 1:1 with Byron this week to deliver the pitch you would've given in Seattle. (G2: Innovation Leadership)

### 📅 Today's Schedule — Engagement Map

| Time | Meeting | Mode | Your Engagement | Multitask Window? |
|------|---------|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| All Day | **Microsoft Visit — Virtual** | 🖥️ Teams | Active listening, contribute when relevant | ⚡ Low-engagement segments |
| 09:30 | ~~M-Files Integration~~ | – | **CANCELED** | ✅ Free |
| 10:00 | Lockton & Deloitte | 🖥️ Teams | Active — Shanna + new resources | ❌ Engaged |
| TBD | AH Sprint 3 Review | 🖥️ Teams | Light — listen for issues | ⚡ Background OK |

**Virtual Reality:** You'll be a face on a screen while the team is in-person. Stay visible — camera on, nod, ask 1-2 good questions. But use low-engagement windows (demos, deep technical dives not in your lane) for focused work.

### ⚡ Multitask Priorities (for low-engagement windows)

| Priority | Task | Time Needed | Why Now |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | **Synthesize survey deck** — polish key themes | 45-60 min | Due 1/30, feeds Innovation Sprint |
| 2️⃣ | **Call Nav on Puru promotion** | 15 min | Open thread, close it |
| 3️⃣ | **Book NYC Glenn/Claude trip** | 10 min | Quick win, off the list |
| 4️⃣ | **Thomas - 90 day plan** | 30 min | Draft outline |
| 5️⃣ | **Schedule Byron 1:1** | 5 min | Replace the lost Seattle pitch |

### ✅ Things 3: Today

- **Talk to Byron on Crema/Certs** ← Schedule separate call or Teams chat
- **Book NYC Glenn/Claude trip** ← Quick win

### Capture
- Yesterday spent the day from morning 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. at the DFW Airport. When you miss a flight or are held on by hope, I wonder if the airports encourage the Stockholm Syndrome for us to be able to hang on to that little hope that the next time on the display might be the true one. Just might be the true one or the crew just might be on their way all the way till the end. It felt like the movie Terminal. The people watching was great. I was able to work on the KJ-360 portal and a few others but when you go through hard times like that, it definitely builds character. It slows life down to those moments where you're able to observe other people from all walks of life, the privileged, the self-absorbed, to the kindest souls you'll ever come across. 
- I came home so tired, crashing the bed, only to find the annoying fire monitor beep go off so loud. I slept on the couch and I'm sleeping on the couch again tonight because, while it's quiet right now, I'm afraid the moment I fall asleep is when it's gonna start going off.

I love to fix that. When I get back from New York, I'm going to Kansas City tomorrow to Jamie's and then we're flying to New York on Thursday.

Horoscope 

Jan 26-Feb 1

It is right in the heart of the working week that the Moon will return for its second visit to your romantic sector for the year. Yet when the Moon comes full circle from beginning the year here, it will be to find that a lot has changed and that includes a much better chance of competing with the working week and all the roadblocks and barriers life can throw in the path of these romantically charged lunar vibes.

This is the Moon's only visit during your birthday month and while Venus, Mercury and Mars, the planets of love, communication and passion are in Aquarius. The Moon will form a friendly aspect to them all as it moves through, giving the spirit of romance some serious backing while helping Venus in her mission to update your romantic and relationship desires, hopes and aspirations for the coming year. Helping with that will not only be the Moon's return to your relationship sector over the weekend, but as a Full Moon. This time, instead of a friendly aspect to the Sun and planets in Aquarius, the Moon will clash with them all to get to better understand what you want from your relationships and what they need from you.
