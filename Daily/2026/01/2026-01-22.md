- I need Puru to be promoted too - Naveen

Jannifer Bryant
- Excited to help me with the Innovation Sprint - 3 person committee Bryant, Shanna and I 
- New building Associate Experience - ask my direct reports for input 
	- Relocation impact - what is the monetary impact 
	- Add this to the market adjustment
- 

### Autocert Available
- Brian Roberts & Bocanegra 
	- Leaning towards Injala
		- Megan shared that there will be IT involvement
		- There is an AI extraction 
	- Laurel not keen on IT 
	- Launching Injala by Jul
	- Claude reached out to 

### Invoicing Brainstorm 

Rob Mayo, Amy Guthrie, Brian Bonecutter, Nandini G, Cami Tritsch, Martin Hershy, Jessica Burche 

**Rob Mayo**

- We create invoices in Soluto
- Receivables will go into Sagitta - match the invoice number 
- Cash app can match the money back to invoice app 
- 60-90 day turnaround

	Could this work for P&C? 

**Amy Guthrie**
- 6 BUs 
- Founders is looking to something for the clients ASAP
- What other options? 

**Martin Hershy**
- Client Hub 
	- Invoice creation
	- Invoice delivery - more important
	- Portal access - real time access to information - important
	- Payment portal (less of a need)
	- Dissemnitation of payments
	- Custom front end - branding
	- Build custom integrations
		- APIs
	- Contract terms automation - Rob priority 
		- installments 
		- calendar of delivery

Features
- Client facing 
- Sagitta retirement?
- Nexsure retirement?

Alternatives
- ePay Policy  - Affinity & personal lines
- Ascend - PRS
- Comulate - doesnt do delivery 

*Note: P&C doesnt really have an AMS - *

Next Step
- Soluto demo and pricing
	- Risk requirements - Martin
	- Hub - Matt Smith, Molly & Phil 
- Forrester 

More to come
- Direct billing
- PWP
- Revenue Leakage
### Capture
-

## 🌙 Evening Close

🏆 **Win:** Got through promotions, kicked off EA proposal evaluation (Perficient + Forrester — need a 3rd option: CapG? Slalom?). Got rucking in.

📈 **Better:** Content with the day — no complaints.

🙏 **Grateful:** A productive day.

🎯 **Tomorrow's #1:** Byron deliverable pushed to 2/7 — pressure's off for Saturday. Seattle next week = opportunity to sell the Innovation Sprint idea over a drink. Friday: focus on shaping the pitch.
