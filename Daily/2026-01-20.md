**Lockton Listens Survey Results**

- Byron - pay for training that makes sense for the role 
	- Use performance review to have training
	- Create a training plan for your year
- Change & Collaboration
	- Acknowledging - from Digital 
	- For Lockton in general - Nick and Tim driving a metamorphosis from Series-led to National Practice
	- Ron - 12/9/24 meeting at Boca Raton
		- Martin & Byron had plans 
		- Legal, Fin & Marketing - got crucified by Tim 
			- They relied on COOs versus working directly with the teams

### Salesforce Licensing
- ![[Pasted image 20260120160628.png]]
**International messaging for Byron**
- We were facing 9% increase - negotiated 
	- Instead of 9% on the total cost, we negotiated it to be flat
	- We have a lot changing, hence we did the 1 year deal 
	- Dont penalize us as a partner
- Before you buy bulk - let us aggregate your needs 
	- Add-ons - $79 -> $59
- Over a 100 - lets talk before we are going to know more 
	- Potential for a bigger reset for the price 
- Premium Support
- **My action item: Negotiate with Brandon from Salesforce to get credits for $99,000. Update Byron with result in 2-3 weeks. Subtask - setup a cal lwith Brandon.**

### Capture
- Great day of productivity
- Feeling a huge sense of accomplishment with the LinkedIn post 
- Counts towards external visibility goal!
