## Workspace

### Deep Work
#### Innovation Thesis Session (with Claudian)

**Completed:** Answered the 3 prompt questions → created [[Innovation Thesis]] v0.1

**The One-Liner:**
> "AI in insurance isn't a technology project — it's a workforce transformation. Our digital investments create the foundation; now we scale by enabling every person to use it."

**Three Pillars:**
1. **From Pilots to Production** — infrastructure for scale (messy middle)
2. **Workforce Enablement** — AI intuition for everyone, not just pilot teams
3. **Innovation Discipline** — outcomes over glamour, success criteria upfront

**Key Framing:** Additive, not critical. The digital team's POCs are the foundation — thesis is about scaling that foundation, not replacing it.

**Future Research Flagged:**
- Regional analysis (Americas vs Europe vs APAC)
- Lloyd's digital marketplace as leading edge
- Who's doing this well? (reference companies)

### Meeting Notes
