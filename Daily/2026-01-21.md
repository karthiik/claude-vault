**Subject:** Budget for Producer org Resources

Hi Jamie,

I think the bare minimum we need for the org is an Admin (Rachana) and a BA. To be safe, we should at least budget for:

- Onshore Contract BA & QA $115,000 (for 7 months because sometimes we aren’t able to convert right at 6 months)
- FTE Onshore BA $50,000 (5 months)
- FTE Onshore Admin/Developer (Rachana) $125,000
- Provide capacity planning - track and share 
- 

**Total $290,000**

… and/or an offshore developer would only be $55,000, but they would not be available during the day to resolve bugs. If you’re able, with as many requests come in, I do think we would be able to fully utilize a second developer.

Let me know if you need anything else!

### Lis Fannin

- Rick Garcia - Use CapG resources in the interim
- Associate Hub - low volume 
- Producer ogr - aligned. ! admin/dev onshore - 1 offshore. AH BAs to moonlight for Producer KTLO
- Shravan potentially in my team - need salary expectations
- Backfill BA - let Bowman go
- Shravan said for remote 60-65 LPA and that he is open for discussion.



### Capture
-

## Evening Close

**🏆 Win:** Producer Org clarity — solid alignment with Nate and Lis on resourcing, structure, and path forward.

**📈 Better:** Protect focus time better. Too many meetings fragmenting deep work blocks.

**🙏 Grateful:** All the ideas that keep me motivated to do better and more.

**🎯 Tomorrow's #1:** Define and rally the troops around the [[1-Projects/Innovation Sprint/0_Innovation_Sprint_Index|Innovation Sprint]].
